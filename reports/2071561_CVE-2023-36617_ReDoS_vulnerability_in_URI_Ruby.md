> A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component through 0.12.1 for Ruby. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. There is an increase in execution time for parsing strings to URI objects with rfc2396_parser.rb and rfc3986_parser.rb.

> NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-28755.

## Impact

Parsing of URIs may cause ReDoS.
Especially when using RFC2396_Parser, even Ruby 3.2.x is affected.
