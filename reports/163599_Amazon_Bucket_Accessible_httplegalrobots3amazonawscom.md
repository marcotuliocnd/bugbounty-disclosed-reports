## Vulnerability Information
Seeing your s3 Amazon bucket, the problem is, visiting your amazon bucket will shows the files on the bucket, while  secure bucket would bring up an access denied page. I have attached Screenshots comparing your bucket with secure bucket to show you what a secure bucket looks like and where the bucket is being used in your source code.
