## Vulnerability Information
libcurl offers a feature to verify an SSH server's public key using a SHA 256
hash. When this check fails, libcurl would free the memory for the fingerprint
before it returns an error message containing the (now freed) hash.

Affected versions: curl 7.81.0 to and including 8.0.1
Not affected versions: curl < 7.81.0 and curl >= 8.1.0

that might be shown to users or otherwise get leaked and revealed.
