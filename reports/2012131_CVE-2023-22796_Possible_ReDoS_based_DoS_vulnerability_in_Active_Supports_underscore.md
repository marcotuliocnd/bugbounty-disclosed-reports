> A specially crafted string passed to the underscore method can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability.
> This affects String#underscore, ActiveSupport::Inflector.underscore, String#titleize, and any other methods using these.
> All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

## Impact

ReDoS when `.underscore` uses user input.
Also, `titleize`, `tableize`, and `foreign_key` using `.underscore` will also have the same problem.
