## Impact

A short explanation of why all organisations believe this is a technical security vulnerability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I visited this domain [ https://█████████/ ]

I found different types of emails from snov.io. And there are a lot of emails that are internal information about your organisation.

That should not be known to the public. An attacker can copy those emails and then they can do email spoofing or email

bombing with those emails. If an attacker can use those emails he/she then can send messages, not from your organisation. He or she can write

bad messages or wrong messages or false messages or scam messages to those victims. They can make a reputation loss.

They can send harmful news/false news/malicious files. They can do phishing attacks and steal the internal information of your organisation.

Sometimes it may occur different types of account hacks.
