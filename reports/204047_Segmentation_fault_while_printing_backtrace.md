## Vulnerability Information
The code below crashes the sandbox/mruby as it tries to print the backtrace. Incidentally, it does not crash mirb.
```
def foo(n)
  return '\'Â 
  if n \n' ensure % 
  if:n != if n == -1110
  else foo(n-1).%  
  end
end %foo(0)
```

We are still examining the bug and hope to produce a detailed analysis and a fix this week.

Thank you,
