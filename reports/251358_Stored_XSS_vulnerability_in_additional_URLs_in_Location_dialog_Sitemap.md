## Vulnerability Information
## Intro

"Transformers: Dark of the Crayons"

__Type of issue__: Core CMS issue
__Level of severity__: Internal Attack Vector
__Concrete5 version__: 8.2.0 RC2 rev. 0a26b63c4a64d42e7afb36aba0a6e4d1f4c53d7d (July 19th)

## Summary

There is Stored XSS vulnerability in additional URLs in 'Location' dialog. This issue can be exploited only against other users which have rights to edit page attributes in Sitemap.


## Steps to reproduce

- log in to concrete5 instance and enable Conversations feature
- go to Sitemap. Click on any page and select ```Location``` option from menu:

{F204663}

- in dialog box, click on ```Add URL```. In new text input put the following payload:

```javascript
',row:1}));alert("xss in path");debugger;(({y:'1
```

- save changes

{F204662}

- click on editied page and select ```Location``` option from menu
- payload is executed and alert is displayed


{F204664}

Here's how payload escapes from legitimate JavaScript code, executes alert() call and keeps syntax with no errors:

```JavaScript
$('table.ccm-page-panel-detail-location-paths tbody').append(
        renderPagePath({
			isAutoGenerated: 0,
			isCanonical: 0,
			isHome: 1,
			pagePath: '/',row:1}));alert("xss in path");debugger;(({y:'1',
			row: 2		})
	);
    
```
