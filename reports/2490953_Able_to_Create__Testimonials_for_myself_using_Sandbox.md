## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:** Recently you allowed us to give testimonials for the sandbox reports which is Vulnerable and allows all the researcher to control their  **Testimonials** for their benefit t.

**Description:**
When a report is closed as resolved we are given the option of "This hacker is eligible for a testimonial" in the Sandbox report and if we fill out this form and submit it for our own Profile and then go to our profile setting "https://hackerone.com/settings/feedback" and turn on "Show this blurb on my profile" On then this Testimonial will be shown in our Public Profile of Hackerone.

With a Single Sandbox Program I can create more than 50 Testimonials for myself that I have Hacked and I am a good hacker.
Here the Credibility of the Hackeron testimonial system will fail completely as the Other users can only see that a Private program gave them a review and don't know which program or a Sandbox Program.


### Steps To Reproduce

1. With your second ID create a Sandbox Program  and Invite your active ID to that Program
2. with the Active ID Create a Few reports for your own Sandbox Program
3. Now with the Second ID closed all those reports as Resolved  and a form for Testtiomonial will pop up at the top of the report  "This hacker is eligible for a testimonial"
4. Fill out this form and submit it.
5. From Active ID go to the feedback section "https://hackerone.com/settings/feedback" and  turn on "Show this blurb on my profile" On

Now visit your Public Profile of  the active ID **Testimonials**  will be live and visible to all
