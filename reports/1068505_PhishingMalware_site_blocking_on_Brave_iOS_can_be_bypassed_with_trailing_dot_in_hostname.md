## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:

Phishing/Malware site blocking feature on Brave iOS blocks navigation to the domains in [simple_malware.txt](https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/blob/821785db8fc71fd084a8a0b2600ff43ea7165ce9/Client/WebFilters/SafeBrowsing/Lists/simple_malware.txt).
But that logic doesn't care existence of a trailing dot in the hostname, so http://3e1.cn/ in the list is correctly blocked but [http://3e1.cn./](http://3e1.cn./) is not blocked.

Safe browsing in Brave for PC/Mac (Chromium based) can blocks both URLs, so Brave iOS should align with it.

## Products affected: 

* Brave iOS nightly build

## Steps To Reproduce:

* Enable "Blocking Phishing and Malware" feature on Setting
* Open [http://3e1.cn./](http://3e1.cn./)

## Supporting Material/References:

  * See attached demonstration movie file

## Impact

User is taken to the prohibited malware/phishing site with bypassing Brave Shield protection.
