### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The alert dialog appears after clicking "green triangle " in created page.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

the png file it must be not executed as  `image/svg+xml`

## Impact

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page
