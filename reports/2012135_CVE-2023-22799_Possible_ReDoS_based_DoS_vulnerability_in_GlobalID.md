https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2023-22799-possible-redos-based-dos-vulnerability-in-globalid/82127
> There is a possible DoS vulnerability in the model name parsing section of the GlobalID gem. Carefully crafted input can cause the regular expression engine to take an unexpected amount of time. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

## Impact

ReDoS occurs in Global ID uri parsing.
Global ID is supposed to be used in ActiveJob, but it is also used in libraries such as GraphQL Ruby and uses user input.
