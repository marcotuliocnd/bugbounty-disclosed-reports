## Vulnerability Information
Hello Security Team

Summary : When looking for links and trying for content discovery i found a link on domain support.theendlessweb.com

https://support.theendlessweb.com/__swift/apps/base/javascript/__global/thirdparty/TinyMCE/tinymce.min.js

It contains the tinyMCE plugin and the version they are using and also disclosing some source code .

tiny MCE version used : 4.3.12 (2016-05-10)

https://support.theendlessweb.com/__swift/apps/base/javascript/__global/thirdparty/TinyMCE
above mentioned link when searched gives a 403 access denied which means nobody is allowed to view the contents but appending the js file to the link displaying the plugin code .

With Regards
