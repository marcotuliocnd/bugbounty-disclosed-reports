## Vulnerability Information
A regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsing HTTP Accept headers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers, causing the server to spend excessive time processing the request and leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This vulnerability affects Rack versions greater than 3.0.0 and up to and including 3.1.4

## Impact

Any unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request, causing the server to spend excessive time processing the request and potentially making the server unavailable.
