## Summary:

I found Host Header injection in oslo.io  
I tried to use it to show the security effect on users And I found this

## Steps To Reproduce:

 1. Well, first of all, enter your project 
2.Make an invitation by email 
3.Now through the burpsuite 
If we try to change the host, 403 will appear
  {F1145857}

So we will use  ```X-Forwarded-Host:  example.com```
 
PoC :

Many things can be done, including deceiving the user and referring to something else or a login page and stealing their account
