## Impact

Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or exploitable.

Note: Some legacy uses of the 'AddType' directive to connect a request to a handler must be ported to 'SetHandler' after this fix.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.
