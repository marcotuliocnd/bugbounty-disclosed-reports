## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
A server can send an HTTP response with many occurrences of Transfer-Encoding and/or Content-Encoding headers. Each listed encoding allocates a buffer. The number of encodings listed within each header is already bounded but the number of headers is not, allowing an HTTP response to consume all available memory.

## Steps To Reproduce:
Using the curl test environment:

  1. Extract test418 from the attached patch
  2. runtests.pl 418
 
## Supporting Material/References:
Patch fixing the problem and new test for the case.

## Impact

Denial of service.
