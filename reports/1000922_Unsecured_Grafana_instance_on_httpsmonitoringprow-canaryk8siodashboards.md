## Vulnerability Information
Hi,
I was looking at  https://monitoring.prow-canary.k8s.io Grafana webapp. I'm not sure if it is for demo purposes, but I can access the main dashboard and view all graphs. 
`https://monitoring.prow-canary.k8s.io/dashboards`

If indeed it is for demo purposes, please let me close the report myself.
looking forward to hearing from you
Thank you
