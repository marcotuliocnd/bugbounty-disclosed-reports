## Vulnerability Information

## Summary:

All details were provided in the original report. You can read it [here](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/2723)

I'm reporting it here because I asked [bcrypt](https://twitter.com/bcrypt) if I should do it and he told me this:


{F127893}


As she said me, I'm reporting here and indicating it's for a retroactive reward.
If any identity confirmation or link between my Github account and my H1 account is needed, please, feel free to ask for it.

Kind regards.
