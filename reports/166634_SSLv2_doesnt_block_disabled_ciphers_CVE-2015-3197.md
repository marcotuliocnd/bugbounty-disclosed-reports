## Vulnerability Information
This is a DROWN-related issue that essentially circumvented the instructions on how to disable SSLv2 at the time. Its primary effect was that a lot of servers were vulnerable to DROWN even though they thought they had SSLv2 disabled.
It was reported to OpenSSL and fixed in versions 1.0.2f and 1.0.1r:
https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160128.txt

(and obviously the DROWN attack itself was reported to OpenSSL, as explained in this OpenSSL blogpost:

Thanks!
