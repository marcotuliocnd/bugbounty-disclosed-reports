## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
It is possible to execute GraphQL introspection query through unauthenticated WebSocket connection. PoC included.

## Steps To Reproduce:
To simplify reproducing I provided a simple html PoC file.

  1. Start python static http server in directory with poc file: `python3 -m http.server` (this step is required to bypass CORS restrictions for opening local file in the browser)
  1. Open file in the browser: http://localhost:8000/ws.html
  1. GraphQL schema dump will be displayed on the page

The problem occurs because of the websocket request with type `start`(maybe others too, I didn't check) allows to pass introspection query in it (`{type: "start", payload: {query: "query IntrospectionQuery{ ... }"}}`)
