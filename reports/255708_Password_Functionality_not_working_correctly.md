## Vulnerability Information
Your password functionality rules are:-

1.Your password should contain at least 8 character:-  Correct working
2. Should contains mixtures of numbers and other symbols:-  Incorrect working.

I create a password with only the characters and its working. 

Kindly remove that functionality or improve it. Otherwise it may be a  target for the brute force attack.
