## Vulnerability Information
Hi IBB :)
in Django i found a potential Dos in IPv6 validation.
Due to Lack of upper bound limit enforcement in strings passed in IPv6 validation(`is_valid_ipv6_address,clean_ipv6_address`  methods) ,when a large malformed string with repeatable `:` characters like, `abcd:abcd:abcd:.....` is passed that cause huge resource consumption and slower processing which results in denial-of-service attack . 

you can see my cve (CVE-2024-56374) with Security Advisory here:
