## Vulnerability Information
Hello
I recently found a bug that without entering First and Last name the profile got updated, means a user can able to put his/her full name blank. In your website there is a validation for first and last name. If a user fill the first name then he has to fill the last name too and vice-versa but if he put both the field blank then he can update his profile and put his full name blank.
POC is attached with this report.
Thank you
Regards 
Prince Sinha
