## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
When using wolfSSL as the TLS backend, certificate pinning does not work when using HTTP/3.
The code should invoke `wssl_verify_pinned()`, but it has not been implemented.

## Affected version
```
# curl -V
WARNING: this libcurl is Debug-enabled, do not use in production

curl 8.13.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.13.0 wolfSSL/5.8.0 zlib/1.3.1 libidn2/2.3.8 libpsl/0.21.2 ngtcp2/1.13.0-DEV nghttp3/1.1
Release-Date: 2025-04-02
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp ws wss
Features: alt-svc AsynchDNS Debug HSTS HTTP3 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Largefile libz PSL SSL threadsafe TrackMemory UnixSockets
```

## Steps To Reproduce:
I will explain using a connection to google.com as an example.

  1. Prepare curl with WolfSSL backend.
  1. curl --http3 https://google.com --pinnedpubkey sha256//ffff

It should result in an error because the specified public key and the certificate's public key are different, but no error occurs.

An error occurs when using HTTP/1.1.
An error occurs when the TLS backend is OpenSSL or GnuTLS.

## Impact

Bypassing Certificate Pinning.
