## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:

No rate limit check on forgot password which can lead to mass mailing and spamming of users and possible employees
A little bit about Rate Limit:
A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP-address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache.
In case a client made too many requests within a given timeframe, HTTP-Servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests or you can include a captcha to limit request.
