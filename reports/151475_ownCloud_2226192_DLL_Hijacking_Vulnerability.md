The vulnerability exists due to some DLL file is loaded by 'ownCloud-2.2.2.6192-setup.exe' improperly. And it allows an attacker to load this DLL file of the attackerâ€™s choosing that could execute arbitrary code without the user's knowledge.

Affected Product:
ownCloud 2.2.2.6192

Impact
Attacker can exploit this vulnerability to load a DLL file of the attacker's choosing that could execute arbitrary code. This may help attacker to Successful exploit the system if user creates shell as a DLL.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

Base Score: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

More Details:
For software downloaded with a web browser the application directory is typically the user's "Downloads" directory: see <https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2008/09/carpet-bombing-and-directory-poisoning.html>,
<http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2012/02/downloads-folder-binary-planting.html>
and <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134> for "prior art" about this well-known and well-documented vulnerability.

If an attacker places malicious DLL in the user's "Downloads" directory (for example per "drive-by download" or "social engineering") this vulnerability becomes a remote code execution.

Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
