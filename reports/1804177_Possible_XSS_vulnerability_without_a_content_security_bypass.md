## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
Hi security team members,

Hope you are well and doing great :)

I found a **Possible XSS vulnerability in https://dashboard.stripe.com but I was not able to bypass a content security policy.**

Although, I don't have much knowledge about CSP and its bypasses. But, I read that you accept the XSS without a content security bypass. So, I'm reporting this to you.
> Please note that we do accept and reward submissions for valid cross-site scripting vulnerabilities even if they are not accompanied by a bypass of our content security policy. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities without a content security bypass will be assessed at a lower severity level than those with a bypass.

## Description:
This occurs when you create a `custom link` with the `javascript://%0aalert(1)` through a [stripe app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/custom-links). And, It gives a **CSP refused executing error** on clicking the custom link.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Install this `Custom Link` app:- https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/custom-links
2. Now, Go to your products and then create a `Custom Link` with this `javascript://%0aalert(1)` as a link

3. Then, Once you click on the custom link that you just created. It will doesn't execute because of CSP.

4. You can verify this by opening your `Console`.
