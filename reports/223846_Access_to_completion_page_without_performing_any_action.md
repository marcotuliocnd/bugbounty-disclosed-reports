## Vulnerability Information
Hi!,

This is much of a best practice as it doesn't have much impact on the user. But I believe you may want to know.

After making a registration or on finalizing a password reset, one is redirected to a page, https://demo.weblate.org/accounts/email-sent/. I noticed that even without making any of the two actions stated above, the page is still accessible.

Regards,
Shuaib
