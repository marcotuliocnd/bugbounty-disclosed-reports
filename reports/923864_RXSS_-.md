## Vulnerability Information
Hello, friends today when I was checking some sites I found this bug on your own website.


##Detalis XSS
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
[OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)



##Steps To Reproduce
Go to Those Links.
`https://███/(A(%22onerror='alert%601%60'testabcd))/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f`

##Browsers
I test them on Firefox and Google Chrome.

##Fix:-
Filter input on arrival
Encode data on output

Content Security Policy.
These all are standards concepts for fix the XSS vulnerabilities.
