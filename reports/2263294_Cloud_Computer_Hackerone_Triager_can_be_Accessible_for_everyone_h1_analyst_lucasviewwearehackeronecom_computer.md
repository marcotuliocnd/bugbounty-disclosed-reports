## Vulnerability Information
==This report was reported to program #2262768 at the request of h1_analyst_shiva I re-reported it here==
=========================================================================================

hello dear 

I don't know if I should send this report to HackerOne or to █████████

Although this is not a bug, but obviously a forgetfulness, but the impact will be very bad and great if the computer contains important and sensitive data and information that can be easily controlled by hackers and researchers and hacked be done

I've been working on ████████ for a long time. Today I saw that the computer of one of the Triagers is online while we have a big time difference with Europe and the United States, so I was surprised to see this in this section
```

```

When I went to the h1_analyst_lucas+view@wearehackerone.com site table, I saw that it was still online and you could use the remote shell to log in to the computer

{F2881374}

Note that I have not used any commands except these to verify my report

```
ls
cd ..
cd  Users
ls
done
```

In ████, it's normal for all users to see other people's computers, but I don't think it's normal for Hackerone staff and Triager
