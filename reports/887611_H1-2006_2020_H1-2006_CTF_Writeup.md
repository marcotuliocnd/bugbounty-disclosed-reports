## Vulnerability Information
Hi! 

The challenges were really great. I had a lot of fun and I can honestly say I learned a few tricks during this journey.

I will be submitting the flag now and will work on a very good writeup until the deadline. My reasoning is that there are two different prizes, one for the first ten and another prize for the best writeup, and I would like to qualify to both. And also I'm really tired to do the writeup right now :)))
