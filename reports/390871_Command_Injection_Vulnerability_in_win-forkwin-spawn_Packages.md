## Vulnerability Information
I would like to report a command injection vulnerability in  win-fork and win-spawn packages.
It allows an attacker to inject multiple commands in exec-like manner.

# Module

**module name:** win-spawn
**version:** 2.0.0
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/win-spawn`
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/win-fork`

## Module Description

Spawn for node.js but in a way that works regardless of which OS you're using. Use this if you want to use spawn with a JavaScript file. It works by explicitly invoking node on windows. It also shims support for environment variable setting by attempting to parse the command with a regex. Since all modification is wrapped in if (os === 'Windows_NT') it can be safely used on non-windows systems and will not break anything.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

Even though this module is advertised to work like spawn, on windows, it works like exec.

## Steps To Reproduce:

To check the params passed to cmd.exe:
```js
var os = require('os').type = function() {return "Windows_NT"};
require("child_process").spawn = function(a, b) { console.log(a); console.log(b)};
var spawn = require("win-fork");
spawn('dir C:// && date /T', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});
```
It effectively runs "cmd /c 'dir C:// && date /T'" which allow the attacker to run both the commands. Moreover, I believe parameters to win-spawn/win-fork may also be used for injection, but I did not investigate this further.

## Patch

N/A at a minimum, document this behaviour in the package's documentation.

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: N
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

This issue is more a documentation/API issue. The package should state clearly what it does and alert its dependents that on windows, the parameters should be treated as parameters to exec.
