## Vulnerability Information
### **HackerOne API Data Leakage Vulnerability Report - `xvcams.com`**

---

## **Summary:**
A **sensitive data exposure vulnerability** was discovered in the API endpoints of `xvcams.com`. These API responses leak personally identifiable information (PII) of models, including **birthdates, locations, eye color, phone verification statuses, and even internal user IDs**. 

This issue **violates user privacy policies** and can be **exploited for data harvesting, identity theft, targeted phishing, and account takeovers**. 

Previously, **a similar vulnerability was found in another system using the same CDN (`cdn5.vscdns.com`)**, indicating a **systemic security issue.**

---

## **Affected Endpoints:**
### **1️⃣ `/api/models/get-offline-models-by-tags.php`**
📌 **Request Example:**
```
https://www.xvcams.com/api/models/get-offline-models-by-tags.php?sitekey=xvt&tag_id=115&service=girls&t=1714076106516
```
📌 **Sensitive Data Leaked in Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "1153601",
  "name": "Emiy Lopera",
  "image": "https://cdn5.vscdns.com/images/models/samples/4552647.jpg",
  "birthdate": "2001-08-31",
  "age": 23,
  "location": "Brazil",
  "eye_color": "brown",
  "phone": {
    "id": "75725",
    "model_id": "1153601",
    "primary_ext": "375093",
    "username": "MODEL_1153601",
    "incoming_tel_num": "************",
    "country_code": "CO",
    "verified_phone": "1",
    "cpm_cost": "20 Credits Per Minute"
  }
}
```
📌 **Critical Issues:**
- 🚨 **Birthdate exposure** (Used for identity fraud)
- 🚨 **Location data exposure** (Can be used for targeted harassment)
- 🚨 **Phone number metadata** (Shows if a number is verified)
- 🚨 **Internal User IDs & Model IDs** (Can be used for unauthorized API queries)

### **2️⃣ `/api/models/recommend-models-to-cust.php`**
📌 **Request Example:**
```
https://www.xvcams.com/api/models/recommend-models-to-cust.php
https://www.xvcams.com/api/models/recommend-models-to-cust.php?user_id=0&model_id=1078906&t=1726734766762
```
📌 **Sensitive Data Leaked in Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "recommId": "7f5acb3843e7e600bfa18a131c33db09",
      "sample_image_id": "4577134",
      "model_id": 1358038,
      "model_name": "Sally Blazee",
      "model_seo_name": "sally-blazee",
      "interactive": 32,
      "room_status": "O",
      "room_status_char": "O",
      "login_group_title": "Multi-User",
      "login_group_id": 4,
      "multi_user_private": true,
      "service": "girls"
    }
  ]
}
```
📌 **Critical Issues:**
- 🚨 **Exposes internal model IDs** (can be used for brute force enumeration)
- 🚨 **Leaked `recommId` values** (possible user tracking vulnerability)
- 🚨 **Room status leakage** (indicates if a model is online or private)

---

## **Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://www.xvcams.com/api/models/get-offline-models-by-tags.php?sitekey=xvt&tag_id=115&service=girls&t=1714076106516
   ```
2. Observe the API response leaking sensitive information such as **birthdate, location, and phone verification details**.
3. Modify the request **(`tag_id`, `model_id`, `user_id`)** to retrieve different users' data.
4. Perform the same steps on:
   ```
   https://www.xvcams.com/api/models/recommend-models-to-cust.php?user_id=0&model_id=1078906&t=1726734766762
   ```
   and notice the exposure of internal tracking IDs and session data.

5.

## **Impact:**
🚨 **This vulnerability exposes personally identifiable information (PII), leading to:**
- **Identity Theft & Fraud** (birthdates + location = easy identity verification attacks)
- **Targeted Harassment & Doxxing** (users' real locations may be exploited)
- **Data Scraping for Black Markets** (massive dataset leaks could be sold or misused)
- **User Tracking via API Enumeration** (revealing whether users are online, offline, or in private rooms)

## **Severity: CRITICAL 🚨**
🔴 **Immediate Fix Required – Exposed User Data Poses High Risk** 🔴

Would appreciate an urgent response regarding the fix. Thank you.
