## Vulnerability Information
Hello,Sifchain Security Team,
I found a bug called Missing CAA. Certificate Authority Authorization (supported by LetsEncrypt and other CAs) allows a domain owner to specify which Certificate Authorities should be allowed to issue certificates for the domain. All CAA-compliant certificate authorities should refuse to issue a certificate unless they are the CA of record for the target site. This helps reduce the threat of a bad guy tricking a Certificate Authority into issuing a phony certificate for your site. The CAA rule is stored as a DNS resource record of type 257. You can view a domainâ€™s CAA rule using a DNS lookup service:

Sifchain should set a CAA record to help prevent misissuance of a certificate for its domains.

## Impact

Impact:-
Domain Authority Can Be Takeover. If you need further information let me know
