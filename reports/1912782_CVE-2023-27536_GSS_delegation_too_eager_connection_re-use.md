## Vulnerability Information
libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the GSS delegation (CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION) option had been changed that could have changed the user's permissions in a second transfer.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, this GSS delegation setting was left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily, affecting krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.

## Hackerone report
#1895135

## Impact

Existing connection that was established via more lax delegation will be reused for connection that should not succeed due to more restrictive delegation requested.
