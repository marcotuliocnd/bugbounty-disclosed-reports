## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:**
Hi team 
**Description:**
If the program is paused that we will not be able to send reports to this program and if we try to directly contact the link https://hackerone.com/external_programm_paused/reports/new we will be returned to the main page https://hackerone.com/external_programm_paused


### Steps To Reproduce


1. PoC ██████████ , ███████
2. 
███████
█████

3. After i will be redirect in main page ████████ and ███████████

Result : ████████, █████████ - private program and status - paused

As it seems to me here insufficient check of authorization of me to these programs at this point

I tested on the second account where there is no program.
