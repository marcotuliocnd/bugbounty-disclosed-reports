## Vulnerability Information
Hello, Reddit!
I hope you are okay in there.
First of all, I want to say one thing, maybe you will not appreciate this report, but at least this report can help users from France to understand the content policy of Reddit, so that if you fix this problem, users from France will understand the policy properly.

Which content is allowed, and which is not.

Even though I'm not from France, I thought it wouldn't hurt me to report this.

Reproduction step:
• Visit https://www.redditinc.com/fr/policies/moderator-guidelines (In French)
• Scroll and see "You are required to comply with our Content Policy", you can click that
• You will be redirected to a 404 page

## Impact

Maybe it's not a serious vulnerability, but at least you fixed it.
Users who are from France will not know what content rules they can create and what content rules they can't create.

I read that Reddit requires each of its users to comply with their content policies, but if the page for a French user is 404, they won't understand it, and maybe if the user is breaking the law by posting something very fatal, they can evade in court.

For example saying "REDDIT doesn't make any content policy rules".

Maybe it's weird, but at least if you fix this, there won't be any weird problems like that.


Best Regards.
Ardyan Vicky Ramadan.
