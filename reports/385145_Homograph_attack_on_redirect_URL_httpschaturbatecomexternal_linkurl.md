## Vulnerability Information
Hi There,

Hope you are doing good,

As i was just playing around with ```chaturbate.com``` and found that you guys does not have proper configuration for malicious script injection in website.

In Homograph attack basically attacker may able to inject some malicious script with URL.

Here i made homograph link for the ```ebay.com```, when normal user see this link its look like normal simple text link but no its not simple link it's crafted homograph malicious script link so when user see this particular link user might be think that they are going to redirect on ```eBay.com``` but the fact that the link which add is malicious link and made from homograph encoding so when user click on this link user will redirect on some malicious website.

The IDN (Malicious link which i add in website) : ```https://xn--eby-7cd.com``` in looking it's look like ```eBay.com``` but when user click this link user will redirect on malicious website.

**Prevention of this vulnerability**

To prevent this vulnerability it would be safer to show the punycode version of the url so it would be apparent that something weird is going on. that is, show ```http://xn--eby-7cd.com/``` instead of ```eBay.com```.

you can see that how hackerone prevent this vulnerability

For instance, Here you can see that in hackerone if i am attaching punycode homograph URL but when you click on this link it will show you actual encryption URL of malicious URL : http://xn--eby-7cd.com/ - Click on this link and you will get know how to prevent this vulnerability or else you can also put prevention by adding validation on particular field for URL.
