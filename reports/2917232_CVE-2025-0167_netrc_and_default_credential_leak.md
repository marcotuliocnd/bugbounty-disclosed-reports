## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
The fix for CVE-2024-11053 seems to be incomplete.The information leak problem could be reproduced again if use netrc in step1.

## Affected version
all

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Adapt test479 to use netrc like below(both of user and password are not provided for b.com): 

machine a.com
  login alice
  password alicespassword

default
  
  2.Run test479
  3. The test would fail because alice and alicepassword  were used for b.com.

I used the latest version curl 8.11.1 but the problem still exists.I'm not sure if this is expected.Please point it out if i'm wrong.
