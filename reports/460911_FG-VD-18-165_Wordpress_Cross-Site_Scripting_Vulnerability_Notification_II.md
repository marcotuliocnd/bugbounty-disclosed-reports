For this particular issue, we will wait until 01/11/2019 for vendor response before we post an advisory on our website (https://fortiguard.com/zeroday) and/or any other publication form (e.g. conference talk, demo, podcast, etc.). 

In the case you agree to patch this issue, we'll extend the disclosure deadline to 90 days (it's 03/12/2019 for this issue) automatically.

We might disclose it *earlier* than that date only if:

2) Active attack against the vulnerability is detected;
3) Or you have patched the vulnerability or released solution/workaround - a positive fact we'll be happy to mention.

Fortinet will use reasonable efforts to communicate a schedule of planned mediums, including conferences with the appropriate stakeholders within the affected company.

Our security researchers work on your product or service either because it is popular and/or interesting, so please take this positively. This research is done free of charge for you, although our researchers will appreciate being mentioned in a Hall of Fame or bug bounty if any. Threats to our security researchers are not acceptable and will be dealt with by our Legal team.
