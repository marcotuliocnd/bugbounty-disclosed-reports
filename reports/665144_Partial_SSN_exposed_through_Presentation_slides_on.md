## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:**
During a search of ████████ I discovered that one of the slides ina presentation contained a screen shot of live data. 
**Description:**
The slides describe testing and using military application to organize and aggregate data on users. On one of the slides it does show a screen shot of actual data. I'm assuming it's live due to the fact that part of it was blocked out like the previous report where it showed XXXX and 4 digits.
