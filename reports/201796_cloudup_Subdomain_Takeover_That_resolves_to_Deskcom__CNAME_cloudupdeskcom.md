## Vulnerability Information
Hi,

While Looking On The CloudUp Website I found That One of The Subdomain of CloudUp [HELP](help.cloudup.com) was Hosted on [Desk](Desk.com) and I think tHe Desk Account of Cloudup was Expired or Canceled by any cause So I have Checked The Site for its CNAME and The CNAME was Resolving to 
###CNAME	http://cloudup.desk.com
So I Tried to Make an Account on [Desk](desk.com) With the same as The CNAME Cloud.desk.com And I was Successful in this Coz Of The Account of cloudup was Expired or cancelled, Now I have setup my page on the site.


But Due to some Problem The Main Domain ***help.cloudup.com (See Screenshot Below 0.png) is Showing SSL Error Maybe due to expired Certificate I'm Not sure as I'm just a Started still have to learn many things! 
So Due to the Error I'm unable to Show my Message on The Main Domain But Still I have Full Control over The CNAME ( See Screenshots) 

Hope This Will Be Resolved

Thanks,
Muhammad Khizer Javed
