## Vulnerability Information
Reported to the project maintainers in 2016. gre_print_0() and the functions modelled after it passed the value of "length" instead of the value of "caplen", this could make ether_print() access beyond the memory allocated for the captured packet. Fixed by https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/0db4dcafe5ae38201d3869c96a96cb714d82ff35.
