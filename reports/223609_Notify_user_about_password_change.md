## Vulnerability Information
Hi,

There is an issue with password reset functionality with Weblate: user is not receiving notification when he reset password.

Good thing: when user change his info like profile update, password change. User get email notification for password change etc.

Issue: user not always gets a notification about password change. When user change his password then a notification is not send to the user.

It is good practice to always send email notification for user when a password change.

Please let me know if more details required.

thanks
