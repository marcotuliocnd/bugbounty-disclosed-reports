## Vulnerability Information
I've been exploring the industry-wide scope of the use of HTTP to resolve dependencies in build infrastructure across the industry. What I unearthed was that some of the most popular libraries and two compilers were impacted by this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability

[CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)
[CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)

The full scope of this vulnerability is captured in my blog post here:
[Want to take over the Java ecosystem? All you need is a MITM!](https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb?source=friends_link&sk=3c99970c55a899ad9ef41f126efcde0e)

This vulnerability impacted the following organizations:

 - Apache Foundation (including the Groovy compiler)
 - Eclipse Foundation
 - Pivotal (including many of the Spring projects)
 - RedHat
 - Jenkins
 - JetBrains (including the Kotlin compiler)
 - Gradle
 - PayPal
 - Netflix
 - Twitter
 - PortSwigger
 - Elastic
- Grails

It also impacted some of the most popular JVM libraries including: 
 - TestNG
 - PowerMock
 - Spock
 - Ehcache
 - Hibernate

The list of projects I publicly disclosed the details of this vulnerability to on GitHub during my research can be found here:

## Resolution

As a part of resolving this issue, I also reached out to Sonatype (Maven Central), JFrog (JCenter), Pivotal (Spring Source), RedHat and the Eclipse Foundation to make a plea to them to completely block port 80 (HTTP) download of dependencies by 2020.

As a direct result of my research [HTTP access to repo1.maven.org and repo.maven.apache.org is being deprecated](https://central.sonatype.org/articles/2019/Apr/30/http-access-to-repo1mavenorg-and-repomavenapacheorg-is-being-deprecated/). That article will be updated shortly with attribution.

# Criteria
> In addition, vulnerabilities should meet most of the following criteria:

##  Be widespread: vulnerability manifests itself across a wide range of products, or impacts a large number of end users.

This impacted some of the most popular and most used open source projects across the JVM ecosystem.

## Have critical impact: vulnerability has extreme negative consequences for the general public.

Absolutely! This vulnerability impacted the supply chain for incredibly popular JVM libraries and 2 compilers. It was incredibly widespread and if it was exploited could have been used to backdoor applications around the world.

## Be novel: vulnerability is new or unusual in an interesting way.

It's really not novel. That's part of what's sad about this. It's such a simple vulnerability and that it impacted so many projects across the industry was just so disturbing.

# Closing

If you have any questions or want additional information, please don't hesitate to ask. There's more information about the scope of this vulnerability than what I was fully able to capture in the blog post.

## Impact

MITM of dependencies could allow a malicious actor to worm the releases of that artifact so they would infect downstream consumers.

A theoretical example of the worst case of this attack can be found in my addendum titled [Letâ€™s write a (theoretical) Java Library Worm](https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/lets-write-a-theoretical-java-library-worm-9a6edff87cf5).

Besides that, this could be leveraged to infect developers machines around the world.
