## Impact

SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTML hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests or content

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60 which fixes this issue. Note: Existing configurations that access UNC paths will have to configure new directive "UNCList" to allow access during request processing.
