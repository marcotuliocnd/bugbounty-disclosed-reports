## Vulnerability Information
Hello,

the name_parse function in libevent's DNS code is vulnerable to a buffer overread.
```c
 935 static int
 936 name_parse(u8 *packet, int length, int *idx, char *name_out, int name_out_len) {
 937     int name_end = -1;
 938     int j = *idx;
 939     int ptr_count = 0;
 940 #define GET32(x) do { if (j + 4 > length) goto err; memcpy(&_t32, packet + j, 4); j += 4; x = ntohl(_t32); } while      (0)
 941 #define GET16(x) do { if (j + 2 > length) goto err; memcpy(&_t, packet + j, 2); j += 2; x = ntohs(_t); } while (0)
 942 #define GET8(x) do { if (j >= length) goto err; x = packet[j++]; } while (0)
 943 
 944     char *cp = name_out;
 945     const char *const end = name_out + name_out_len;
 946 
 947     /* Normally, names are a series of length prefixed strings terminated */
 948     /* with a length of 0 (the lengths are u8's < 63). */
 949     /* However, the length can start with a pair of 1 bits and that */
 950     /* means that the next 14 bits are a pointer within the current */
 951     /* packet. */
 952 
 953     for (;;) {
 954         u8 label_len;
 955         if (j >= length) return -1;
 956         GET8(label_len);
 957         if (!label_len) break;
 958         if (label_len & 0xc0) {
 959             u8 ptr_low;
 960             GET8(ptr_low);
 961             if (name_end < 0) name_end = j;
 962             j = (((int)label_len & 0x3f) << 8) + ptr_low;
 963             /* Make sure that the target offset is in-bounds. */
 964             if (j < 0 || j >= length) return -1;
 965             /* If we've jumped more times than there are characters in the
 966              * message, we must have a loop. */
 967             if (++ptr_count > length) return -1;
 968             continue;
 969         }
 970         if (label_len > 63) return -1;
 971         if (cp != name_out) {
 972             if (cp + 1 >= end) return -1;
 973             *cp++ = '.';
 974         }
 975         if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;
 976         memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);
 977         cp += label_len;
 978         j += label_len;
 979     }
 980     if (cp >= end) return -1;
 981     *cp = '\0';                                                                                                   
 982     if (name_end < 0)
 983         *idx = j;
 984     else
 985         *idx = name_end;
 986     return 0;
 987  err:
 988     return -1;
 989 }
```

Prior to the memcpy on line 976 it is not asserted that the range (```packet + j```) - (```packet + j + label_len```) does not exceed the length of the ```packet``` buffer (as stored in variable ```length```). My proof of concept exploits the possibility to keep jumping around in the buffer (lines 959 - 968), until the buffer index (```j```) is at the very end --- then, an overread of 63 bytes will occur. No overwrite takes place.

As you know, an overread *may* result in a crash, depending on a variety of factors.

I believe the code in Tor is vulnerable and I will update this report with PoC against Tor itself as soon as I've constructed one.

Nobody has been notified of this bug except you. I will not contact the libevent developers about this issue unless you explicitly request so. It's up to you to notify them yourself.

To test against the latest version of libevent (libevent-2.0.22-stable.tar.gz):

```sh
CFLAGS="-fomit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address" ./configure
make -j4
cd samples
./dns-example -servertest
```

in a different terminal run
```sh
python libevent-poc.py
```

Output of ```dns-example``` should be:
```
EVUTIL_AI_CANONNAME in example = 2
