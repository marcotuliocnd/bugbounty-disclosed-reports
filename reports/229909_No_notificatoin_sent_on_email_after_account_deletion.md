## Vulnerability Information
Hi again,

###Description:

As I reported in previous report about account deletion about without entering password #229904 I've just noticed that there's no email notification received after successfully removal of account.

**Fixation:** 
User should be notified by email notification at his email after removal of an account.

Cheers
Mansoor
