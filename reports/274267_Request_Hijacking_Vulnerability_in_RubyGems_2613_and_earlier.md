## Vulnerability Information
We received this report via security@ from david@bamsoftware.com, I'm filing here for tracking and visibility purposes...

"I was looking at commit 8d91516fb7037ecfb27622f605dc40245e0f8d32, which
was the fix for the DNS hijacking issue CVE-2017-0902. The function
still handles the DNS response in a potentially unsafe way. I did not
find any actual vulnerabilities in the current code; the code that uses
the result of api_endpoint (perhaps coincidentally) discards the
potentially malicious components of the URI that api_endpoint returns.
But future code may be vulnerable. I'm sending this to the security list
because my checks for vulnerability may be incomplete.

The problem is that api_endpoint allows the DNS SRV response to contain
URI-like syntax (which was the cause of CVE-2017-0902). The fix was to
parse the syntax as if it were a URI, extract the host component, and
only do a comparison using the host component, rather than the entire
string. However, the entire string is still pasted into the return
value, assuming the comparison succeeds. It can contain URI syntax
characters like '?' and '#' that change the interpretation of what
follows them.

I'm attaching a patch that adds a new test and changes api_endpoint to
discard everything but the host after parsing the DNS SRV response as a
URI. It would probably be even better simply to disallow any syntax
other than hostname literals.

The lines that I initially thought was vulnerable, but appear not to be,
are in lib/rubygems/source.rb:
   bundler_api_uri = api_uri + './api/v1/dependencies'
   uri = api_uri + "#{Gem::MARSHAL_SPEC_DIR}#{spec_file_name}"
   spec_path  = api_uri + "#{file_name}.gz"
The reason they are not vulnerable is that api_url is a URI object
rather than a string, so the + operator is actually the merge method
rather than string concatenation. The merge operator replaces any
existing path, query, and fragment components, it seems. (It would not
help if the attacker-provided string changed the URI's host, pass, or
port components, but I could not think of a realistic path to
exploitation using only those components.) However if api_uri had been
coerced into a string, then the code would be vulnerable. An attacker
could cause the client to download some other path, which could possibly
lead to a downgrade attack or replacing one gem with another.
