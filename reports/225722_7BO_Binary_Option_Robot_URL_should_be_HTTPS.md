## Vulnerability Information
#SUMMARY

This is just for the awareness to use HTTPS everywhere, even for outgoing links - where it's possible.
Treat this report with some salt, not as in hashes.

Not really a security bug, but I think will be a good idea to add HTTPS on 7BO: Binary Option Robot Button.

Navigate this URL:

      https://weblate.org/en/thanks/

Their is 7BO: Binary Option Robot Button as I notice that url not using HTTPS.
