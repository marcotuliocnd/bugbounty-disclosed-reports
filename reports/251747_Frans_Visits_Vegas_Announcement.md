## Vulnerability Information
# Hey hackers and soon to be hackers!

{F204937}

I will be doing a webinar for 1 hour at **21:00pm PDT Wednesday the 26th**, the night before DEFCON and h1-702 2017.

The idea is to share knowledge on how to win over security teams and gain influence as a hacker. I will cover the following topics:

* How I got started
* What I use for hacking
* How to behave among hackers
* How to report and behave among targets and companies
* Q&A!

You’ll be able to send questions using this public program. You send them as regular reports and we’ll publicly disclose the questions for all of you to learn. Ask me anything and I’ll try to answer as good as I can.

Until then,

Frans Rosén, aka, “The Swedish Ninja” (Yea, I’ve always wanted to be called that, I’ll try to make it happen by force)
