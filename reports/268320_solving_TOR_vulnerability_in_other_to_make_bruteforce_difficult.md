|   VULNERABLE:

|   Slowloris DOS attack

|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE

|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750

|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold

|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to

|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves

|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.
