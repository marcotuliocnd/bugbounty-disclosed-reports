## Vulnerability Information
I am sw0rd1ight.I found an Apache Tomcat RCE vulnerability in tomcat 9.0.98. 
If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to perform remote code execution:
- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
- application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the default storage location
- application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack

I reported this vulnerability through the official Apache Tomcat security email and received a fix along with a CVE number CVE-2025-24813.
