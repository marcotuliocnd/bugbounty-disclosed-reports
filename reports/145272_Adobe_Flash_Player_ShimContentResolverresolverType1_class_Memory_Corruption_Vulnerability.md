## Vulnerability Information
I. Summary
Adobe Flash Player is prone to a vulnerability which leads to memory corruption because of improper validation of ShimContentResolver.resolve().
------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Description

However, if ShimContentResolver is constructed with resolverType=1, then invoking resolve() with invalid Opportunity instance, some inner fields of ShimContentResolver will be absent, which will cause a memory crash.
