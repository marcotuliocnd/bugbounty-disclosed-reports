## Vulnerability Information
Hello,

This PoC is using a simple yet powerful trick to detect when Little Flocker, Little Snitch, HandsOff! or BlockBlock window appear then automatically click on the "Allow" button by calculating the distance (so it works pretty well on every resolution). The window only appear for a fraction of second.

More details about this and PoC at https://github.com/pwnsdx/Unsecure

I am submitting this as HandsOff! finally fixed the issue.

Regards,
Sabri.
