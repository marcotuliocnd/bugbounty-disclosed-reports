## Impact

ForgeRock OpenAM before 13.5.1 allows LDAP injection via the Webfinger protocol. For example, an unauthenticated attacker can perform character-by-character retrieval of password hashes, or retrieve a session token or a private key.

## System Host(s)
███████

## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)


## CVE Numbers
CVE-2021-29156

## Steps to Reproduce
The references mentioned shall be helpful for successful reproduction, especially the one I reported the earlier day (#1278050) and the PortSwigger one.

* Username starting with ██████████ exists: https://█████████/███/███████[200 OK]

* Username starting with ███████ doesn't exist: https://██████████/██████████/█████████████[404 Not Found]

For 200 OK response, it also throws out OpenAM instance address: **`███`**

Similar thing can be done for password enumeration as well. You can find the scripts I wrote for username and password enumeration in my earlier report at a different host.
