## Vulnerability Information
Hello.

A few days ago, I was looking at Roblox subdomains, and I noticed an unusual one called creatorforum.roblox.com. Upon further investigation, I visited it and saw that creatorforum.roblox.com's CNAME was a nonexistant Discourse website.
 I immediately reported to info@roblox.com, and eventually talked to Antek Baranski on the bugbounty@roblox.com email address. The issue has been fixed since reporting, but I was told to send a report here.

If I had a Discourse account, I could've taken over the CNAME for creatorforum.roblox.com and then it would've been a full subdomain takeover on that subdomain.

As mentioned earlier in the report, the issue has been resolved and as you can see the subdomain creatorforum.roblox.com no longer exists.


Thanks,
Jack
