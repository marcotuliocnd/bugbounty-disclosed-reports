> An issue was discovered in RDoc 6.3.3 through 6.6.2, as distributed in Ruby 3.x through 3.3.0.
> When parsing .rdoc_options (used for configuration in RDoc) as a YAML file, object injection and resultant remote code execution are possible because there are no restrictions on the classes that can be restored.
> When loading the documentation cache, object injection and resultant remote code execution are also possible if there were a crafted cache.

## Impact

RCE is possible when the `rdoc` command is executed for a repository received from the external.
