## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
We present various examples of side-channel leakage in the communication between a Monero wallet and P2P node. Communication patterns and timing leak whether the wallet is the payee of a transaction that is sent into the transaction pool or mined in a blockâ€”thereby breaking transaction privacy, as well as enabling linking of stealth addresses. 
If a user connects their Monero wallet to a remote node, the required leakage in commu- nication patterns and timing is observable by a malicious (yet passive) remote node provider, or by a passive network adversary that monitors the encrypted traffic between a wallet and a trusted node. Even if the wallet and node are both hosted locally and trusted, side-channel leakage can be observed by an active remote attacker with a P2P connection to the node.

## Releases Affected:

  * Current release (v0.14.1.0) and previous ones of the main Monero node and wallet implementations

## Steps To Reproduce:

The attached report (which we also sent to ric@getmonero.org and luigi1111@getmonero.org via PGP) explains the different vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

## Housekeeping

1. Be sure to read our policy before submitting
2. Provide an XMR address within the report if you wish to receive bounty (assuming that the report is valid)
    - PoC within a report will most likely result in more bounty than not

## Impact

A remote attacker (either in control of a public node, or a network adversary monitoring communication to a remote node, or even a remote P2P participant connected to a wallet's local node) can infer when the wallet is the payee of a transaction added to the mempool or mined in a block.
