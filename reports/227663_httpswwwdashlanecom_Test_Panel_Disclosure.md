## Vulnerability Information
Greetings,

On https://www.dashlane.com/ , I observed that the server discloses test panel at :

https://www.dashlane.com/app/tests/

{F183690}

I found no relation between an account and the following page to do unauthorized tests.

The following tests are available with no credential :
==

- https://www.dashlane.com/app/tests/encrypt.html
- https://www.dashlane.com/app/tests/decrypt.html
- https://www.dashlane.com/app/tests/deflate.html
- https://www.dashlane.com/app/tests/inflate.html
- https://www.dashlane.com/app/tests/unittest.html

For example it was possible to extract a salt or obtain various information :

And we are done here.

I produced a video :

Fix :

The panel should be protected with 403 or 401
