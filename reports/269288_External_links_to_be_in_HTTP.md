## Vulnerability Information
Hello Legal Robot Team

On looking to #260591 report i saw on the main page  https://www.legalrobot.com/ that some external links are not set to be in https

On clicking in that links i get redirected on https. 

Check the attachment and see the other circled one also appears to be same issue.

Thanks
