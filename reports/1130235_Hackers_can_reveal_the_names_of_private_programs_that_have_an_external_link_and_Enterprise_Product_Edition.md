## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:

Hi team,

A few days ago, your engineers revealed a field in the report- `Custom fields`. The team removed it after a while, but did not remove the design line

`Custom fields` Available only for `Enterprise Product Edition` , Therefore, the sandbox program cannot independently accept this version of the product, which means that only a program with an administrator can do this, which means that the program has a private part 

## Steps To Reproduce:
