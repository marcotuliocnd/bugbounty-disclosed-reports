## Vulnerability Information
Hello,

I've discovered a persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the WooCommerce. Yesterday I created a support ticket on the website, but today someone told me about the bug bounty program, so here we go. 

The vulnerability was discovered during a month long security project to find vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins. For more information about the project see:

My advisory can be found in the attachment in text format. If there are any questions please let me know, I'm happy to help.

With kind regards,

Sipke
