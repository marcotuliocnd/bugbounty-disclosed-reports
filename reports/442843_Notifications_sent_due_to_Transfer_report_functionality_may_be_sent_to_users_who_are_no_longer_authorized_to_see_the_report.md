## Vulnerability Information
Hi Hackerone team,

I am still able to access other program details etc. when i'm authenticated to HackerOne through SAML .
I'm not sure if it's the same bug i reported earlier or there is some weak authorization check in place. PFA for more info i can access related to ██████████ etc. See the date it's 16th November .

Quick Note:
Last time when i reported the issue the H1 team decided not to reward it. https://hackerone.com/reports/438306
However this time it's happening again. I can stop reaching out to H1 if they don't reward the ethical researchers who are willing to help their platform more secure.

Please consider this as a  valid finding and reward it this time .

## Impact

This could be a serious issue for HackerOne since the program owners will loose trust in the service and might stop using this platform .
