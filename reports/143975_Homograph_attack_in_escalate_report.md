## Vulnerability Information
Hi There,

i think i found issue lead to forced the victim user to open malicious site: http://ebаy.com/

please open this: http://ebаy.com/  after that you will see external link warning page and you will see the real site: http://xn--eby-7cd.com/ and that's the way you protected users from this attack http://ebаy.com/,

but when i click on show raw >escalate report , there is no external link warning page if i open the malicious site : http://ebаy.com/. as you can see from  this photo: issue.png {F98740} there is no external link warning page.

so i request to add external link warning page in show raw >escalate report for more secure.

Kind Regards,
█████
