## Vulnerability Information
Hey,

I found an open S3 Amazon bucket udemy-maven. While I canâ€™t confirm if you own it or not, it appears that it is publicly writable using the aws cli.

When I write to udemy-maven, I get:
move: ./test.txt to s3://udemy-maven/test.txt

And also when I remove file, I get:
delete: s3://udemy-maven/test.txt

Assuming you own it, the security issue is that someone could delete files or write something malicious into the bucket and someone on your team unknowingly opening it.
