## Vulnerability Information
Hi Weblate,

Hope you all have a good day!
Its a minor issue, but hope you'll fix it.
It seems like after changing password for example my current password is : mypassword1
And lets assume that the hacker got an access to my account, and me of course will change my password to ex. mypassword2.

There's no restriction when i change a new password with a similarity to the old password 
In this way the attacker can still hack account easily because there's a similarity to the old and the new one.

Hope you'll triaged this.
Looking forward to your reply.

Best Regards,
Jolan Saluria
