## Vulnerability Information
I sent my original report here: https://hackerone.com/reports/2490560
REXML had a vulnerability where repeated `>` characters in an attribute value took a very long time for the parser to finish.
The wait times increased exponentially the larger the string.

## Impact

Reduced performance or Denial of Service was possible where REXML is used to parse user input.
Rails uses REXML to convert XML to a hash, so this was susceptible:
```rb
Hash.from_xml(request.body.read)
```
