```
I did a brief search and find my fuzzing finding was very similar to `https://hackerone.com/reports/204421`, which is supposed to be fixed in `https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/f198530444f4b5ebfd011c3287114951c8553e5e`. However, `https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/736be0e98b9e1136a4dc7cb2dd05e1f33728f767#diff-86406329889f2c13524766839f0a96b3` reverted that fix, making the bug present again on current top master branch. So I'm reporting here again as a new issue.

Thanks!
