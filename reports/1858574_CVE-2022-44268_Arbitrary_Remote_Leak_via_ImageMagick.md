## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:**
HackerOne's image upload is using ImageMagick to convert/resize images and is likely updated. Thus, it's vulnerable to CVE-2022-44268.

**Description:**


### Steps To Reproduce
1. Navigate to your profile
2. Edit and upload the attached image (`im-lfi.png`) as your profile picture
3. Save changes and download the resized picture
4. Issue the following command to view the downloaded image's profile data;
```bash
identify -verbose image.png
```
Then, copy the `Raw profile type:` and decode it using any tool or using Python like;
```bash
python -c "print(bytes.fromhex('2c2c2c3a2f72756e2f73797374656d643a2f7573722f7362696e2f6e6f6c6f67696e0a').decode())"
```

I've attached the resized image too which contains the content of /etc/passwd i.e. 86bca9490b71a481329efc85de3a82a98f6c29475f4926fd2b5fc844b96899c0.png
