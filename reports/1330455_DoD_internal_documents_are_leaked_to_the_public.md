Hello Team,

I found a zip file containing documents about DoD. From what I looked at are documents for new soldiers who are starting out, but I didn't just find these files but several others like advice, commander files, plans, certificates and others.

In some of the files I found information such as name, surname, email, phone number and even signatures. Files like these shouldn't be exposed to the public.
