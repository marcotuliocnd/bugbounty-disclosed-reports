## Vulnerability Information
The subdomain at https://support.invisionpower.com has an unclaimed CNAME record ( ipscommunity.zendesk.com ). I checked the username availability in the signup process at Zendesk, it was observed that the subdomain is vulnerable to a subdomain takeover which allows an attacker could exploit such a situation by registering the expired sub domain and setting up a phishing page that mimics the companyâ€™s main support website.

## Impact

Subdomain takeover can be abused to do several things like :
Malware distribution
Phishing / Spear phishing
XSS
Authentication bypass
Legitimate mail sending and receiving on behalf of the ford subdomain
...
The list goes on and on.
