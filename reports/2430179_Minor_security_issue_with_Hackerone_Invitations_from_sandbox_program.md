## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:**
Hello,
I noticed that the Hackerone team have recently enabled "Invite Users" feature to add users to organization in sandbox program. When I try to invite other users through email, I observed that there is no precautionary warning message in email stating that the invitation was sent from an unverified program on H1.
