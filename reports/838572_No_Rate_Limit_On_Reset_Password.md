## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache. In case a client made too many requests within a given time frame, HTTP servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests. (wikipedia)
I just realize that on the reset password page, the request has no rate limit which then can be used to loop through one request.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to https://staging.every.org/resetPassword , enter the email then click reset password
  2. Intercept this request in burp suite

POST /dbconnections/change_password HTTP/1.1
Host: login.every.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:74.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/74.0

{"client_id":"1bT892TGga38o0GFw5EusmGnV9b3kjCq","email":"YOUREMAILADDRESS@gmail.com","connection":"Username-Password-Authentication"}

  3. Send it to the intruder and repeat it by 50 times
  4. You will get 200 OK status
  5. I already attached the PoC video too if you don't understand my explanation
