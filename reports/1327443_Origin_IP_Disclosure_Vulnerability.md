## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
It is possible to access origin IP servers served by nginx and not cloudflare.
Even though these IP's don't serve a functional version of the app it is possible to enable DDoS attacks by bypassing cloudflare protections.

## Steps To Reproduce:
Even though these IP's don't serve a functional version of the app it is possible to enable DDoS attacks by bypassing cloudflare protections.

* Search Keyword "sifchain.finance" --> https://censys.io/ipv4?q=sifchain.finance
* Scroll Down below you found Original IP Revealed.
i.e: 52.88.198.160

This Link bypass Cloudflare WAF :- 52.88.198.160

## Impact

* As Cloudflare bypasses can have a significant impact, as any adversary is now able to communicate with the origin server directly, enabling them to perform unfiltered attacks (such as denial-of-service), and data retrieval.
* It could enable MITM attacks.
