## Vulnerability Information
Hi Team,

Page: https://nextcloud.com/news/16/

Broken link for incorrect DNS entry: ``` <a href="https://conf.nextcloud.comg/" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/promo/8dbb6978d22761589b012ec440d8ab11cc9bb46f/conference/conference-social-media-banner.png"></a> ```

It seems like a typo and makes the tld as .comg instead of .com.

Now other than usability issue for users, it poses security risk as .comg can be claimed as a gTLD since it is not a reserved TLD (Similar to https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Stop+Using+internal+Top+Level+Domain+Names/21095/).

Also in certain cases malware or local network attacker may leverage it by serving .comg via their DNS server.

An attacker may misuse it in phishing scams or for spreading misinformation.

It shall either be removed or updated to avoid the risk associated.

A similar issue @ Twitter which you might find relevant and funny :) -https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14495978/belgian-hacker-trump-twitter-links
