## Vulnerability Information
An attacker supplies a regular expression containing one or more `\xDF` characters after an escape putting the regexp into unicode matching mode, such as a `\N{}` escape.  Each `\xDF` character adds one byte of overflow, and any other text in the regular expression is written in order, providing the attacker control over the bytes written to the overflowed region.

* Reported to the [Perl security mailing list](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132227) on 6 Oct 2017.
* Confirmed as a security flaw by TonyC on 31 Jan 2018
* CVE-2018-6797 assigned to this flaw on 6 Feb 2018
* Patch released to the security mailing list for Perl 5.24 and Perl 5.26 on 09 Feb 2018
* Patch released to the security mailing list for Perl blead on 22 Feb 2018
* [Public security advisory](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/pod/perl5262delta.pod) released on 14 April 2018

On 31 Jan 2018 Perl dev TonyC says in an email to the Perl security mailing list that `depending on the heap implementation it may be possible to perform a nastier exploit - an attacker has almost complete control over the bytes written.`

```

## Impact

Depending on the heap implementation a remote attacker could have complete control over the bytes written to memory.
