## Vulnerability Information
Hello,

The vulnerable code portion is linked below. The linked function is responsible for printing RPKI-Router packet payload information to the terminal (e.g., stdout)

https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/83c64fce3a5226b080e535f5131a8a318f30e79b

The issue may be reproduced as follows

Check out vulnerable tcpdump commit (< 4.9.2) as follows

```
$ git clone -b 289c672020280529fd382f3502efab7100d638ec https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump
```

Build it with afl and AddressSanitizer as follows (please install libpcap before this step)

```
$ CC=afl-gcc
$ AFL_USE_ASAN=1 make -j
```

Run tcpdump against linked payload (link: https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/blob/83c64fce3a5226b080e535f5131a8a318f30e79b/tests/rpki-rtr-oob.pcap?raw=true)

```
$ tcpdump -nvr <payload>
