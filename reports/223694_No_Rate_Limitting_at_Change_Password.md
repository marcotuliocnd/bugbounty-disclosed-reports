## Vulnerability Information
Hello Team,

I found out that you didnt implement a Rate Limitting on Change Password.

**Scenario**
This Scenario is Limited. But some of Programs here consider this. Victim Forgot to logout his/her account in Cafe/Internet Computer Shops. Attacker saw the Account that it is not Logged out having a knowledge with this vulnerability. Attacker dont have any idea about  Victim's Password and allowing him to bruteforce the Victim's Password via Change Password.

**Proof Of Concept**
