## Vulnerability Information
Hello Everyone,

I hope all is safe and you're safe in this pandemic,
and I hope this won't bother you like my previous submitions lol ,


## _Description_ :
The **"allows_private_disclosure"** resource in team for private team that have a public profile is shown there which discloses that this program have a private VRP if they're enabling "Bounty Splitting" to their private bug bounty program,
I'm not 100% sure cause I accidently found that ████████ shows that they're enabling bounty splitting but they runs a VDPs and that made me think that they're running a private VRP with that ,

**NOTE** : As said in the description I'm not totally sure if this a mistake or an actual bug cause I don't have the ability to try it on my own,
if it's just a mistake giving me the free to self-close this report will be too much apperciatable :)
