## Vulnerability Information
#Summary:

This is just for the awareness to use HTTPS everywhere, even for outgoing links - where it's possible.

Treat this report with some salt, not as in hashes.

#Navigate to:

Some of the External Links on that Page redirects to HTTPS after click, but cookie is sent on the network before that.
