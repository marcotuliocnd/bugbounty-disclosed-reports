## Vulnerability Information
Hi all,

I had lots of tests for bug bounty in my test store "trstore-3.myshopify.com" (created about 4 years ago) and then one of your developers noticed that a stored cross-site scripting payload in my staff name fired in another your internal panel. 

I have attached the email sent to me by your collegue  and I'd like to get a award and I am very happy.

Thanks alot.
