## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:** 
After downloading `putty-0.70-2019-01-17.53747ad.tar.gz`, I compiled it on Debian 9 with Clang-8.0.0 and AddressSanitizer and while trying to extract a public key from a crafted key file, I triggered a heap-buffer-overflow in mp_get_decimal().

**Description:**
A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program, or cause the execution of malicious code.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1) Compile putty with Clang and ASan:
`CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address CXXFLAGS=-fsanitize=address ./configure --without-gtk && make --j2`

2) Run puttygen and attempt to extract a public key from the crafted key file:
`./puttygen -L test0013.ppk`

## Impact

1) Buffer overflows generally lead to crashes. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.

2) Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a programâ€™s implicit security policy.

3) When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service.
