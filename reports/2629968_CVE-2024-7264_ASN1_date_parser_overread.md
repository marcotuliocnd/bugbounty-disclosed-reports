## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:

When a specially-crafted certificate is passed to `Curl_extract_certinfo` to parse, it may read bytes beyond the end of the buffer in which the certificate is held. According to the application, this may be a stack read overflow or a heap read overflow.

Specifically the issue is in function `GTime2str`, in which the specially-crafted input may cause it to set `fracl = -1` and then pass it to `Curl_dyn_addf`, which in turn treats this `-1` as "no length given" and goes on to run `strlen(tzp)` which goes beyond the end of the certificate buffer (assuming there are no null bytes).

I believe the issue is in this loop (in `lib/vtls/x509asn1.c`):

```
 524     /* Strip leading zeroes in fractional seconds. */
 525     for(fracl = tzp - fracp - 1; fracl && fracp[fracl - 1] == '0'; fracl--)
 526       ;
```

If `tzp == fracp`, then `fracl` is set to -1 in the loop initialization.

I tested this on curl 8.9.0 commit `2a59c8d4cebfd199f930213ee82ae95f71e44578` (2024-07-24). I haven't looked when the issue was introduced.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Compile libcurl with `-fsanitize=address` and with gnutls. I used clang. `CC=clang CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address ../configure --disable-shared --enable-debug --with-gnutls=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu`
  1. Compile the attached `poc.c` program which uses libcurl's `Curl_extract_certinfo`.
  1. Run `./poc bad_cert_1.bin` 

The resulting report from AddressSanitizer:

```

Note that this will only affect libcurl when built with gnutls, schannel, sectransp, mbedtls (only then it'll use `Curl_extract_certinfo`).

## Supporting Material/References:

  * `poc.c`: The client code to reproduce; it simply reads a file and passes its content to `Curl_extract_certinfo`. The code uses a buffer on the stack, but it also works if you switch it to be a heap buffer (see the commented-out malloc call).
  * `bad_cert_1.bin`: The certificate with which causes the memory over-read.

## Submitter info

  * I used LLVM libFuzzer to find this.
  * If this is accepted, please credit the finding to Dov Murik from Transmit Security.
  * If this is eligible for any bug bounty, please donate it to the curl project.

## Impact

Attacker-controller HTTPS server can return a specially-crafted certificates that can crash libcurl-based clients when fetching the certificates and parsing them.

I couldn't see a way where the remote attacker can actually get the content of the over-read memory bytes.
