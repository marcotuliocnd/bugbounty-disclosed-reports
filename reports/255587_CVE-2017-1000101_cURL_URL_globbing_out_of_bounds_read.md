## Vulnerability Information
**FYI, this security advisory will not be released until 9 August 2017:**
```
curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range
to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers.

In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an
omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a
carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap
based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead
of crashing.

An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be
`http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.
