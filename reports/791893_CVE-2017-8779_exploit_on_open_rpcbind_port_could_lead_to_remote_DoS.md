## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:
An open rpcbind port on https://da.theendlessweb.com allows for possible exploitation by an existing Metasploit module. This could lead to large and unfreed memory allocations for XDR strings.

## Description:
Port scanning on 149.56.38.19 which is the IP of https://da.theendlessweb.com shows open port 111 which runs 'rpcbind'. By using the auxiliary module auxiliary/dos/rpc/rpcbomb in Metasploit, it is possible to exploit the port and cause large memory allocations for XDR strings. Excessive memory allocations could exhaust the systems memory leading to a Denial of Service.

As can be seen in the following screenshot:
(please note that I did not expect the module to work therefore I continued the test, I am aware that causing a DoS is a serious offense and do not intend to do any damage)

F711567

The exploit was completed successfully. I did not continue any further out of fear of unintended damage to the site.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Open the Metasploit framework and type 'use auxiliary/dos/rpc/rpcbomb'
  2. set RHOSTS to 149.56.38.19 and RPORT to 111
  3. Type 'exploit'

##Solution/ Mitigation
Close or filter port 111

## Impact

An attacker could use this vulnerability to trigger large unfreed memory allocations on the system leading to a remote Denial of Service.
