## Vulnerability Information
Hi Security team,

I would like to report a vulnerability bypass firewall.
when you are trying to navigate this  [link](https://newsletter.nextcloud.com/admin) it needs authentication
but itâ€™s possible to access to admin panel when you add `index.php` after `/admin/`.
`https://newsletter.nextcloud.com/admin/index.php`

P.o.C : video in attachment.
