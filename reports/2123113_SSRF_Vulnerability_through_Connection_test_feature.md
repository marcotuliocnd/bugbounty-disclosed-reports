## Vulnerability Information
An SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attack can potentially be executed through the connection test feature, specifically when interacting with the Slack API. This attack allows an attacker to see the plain response, providing them with information that can aid in exploiting the vulnerability, rather than relying solely on blind SSRF techniques.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows the user to access connection information and exploit the test connection feature by sending many requests, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on the server. Furthermore, malicious actors can leverage this vulnerability to establish harmful connections with the server, hit on metadata endpoints.
