## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:**
I don't know if this qualifies but during my search I discovered an open FTP panel that I was able to successfully log into.   
Using any FTP program,  I used File zilla and then entered ████  as my host then connected. Then I was able to look through any of the files. I noticed the last modified file was  quite recent leading me to believe it's still in us
