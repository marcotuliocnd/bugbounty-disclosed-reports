## Vulnerability Information
Description: Gratipay is not validating csrf token at server side for few requests. So csrf protection is not implemented application wide.

Recommended Fix:
For CSRF Protection:
1. Each critical operation request must be accompanied with a "token"
â€¢Token is:
- Long, Random, not repeated for application lifetime.
- Unique per session or even per operation
- Part of URL in GET
- Hidden Field in POST (forms)
- Attacker cannot know / predict this token and hence cannot create requests to exploit the operation.
