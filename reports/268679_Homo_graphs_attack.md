Hi there, 

Greeting for the day, hope you are doing good, 

In Federa localhost i found homograph attack, 

Here i made homograph for the ```ebay.com```, when see this link its look like normal simple text link but no its not, however, when you click on this particular link you might be think that you are going to redirect on ```eBay.com``` but the fact that the link which add is malicious link and made from homograph encoding so when you click on this link you will redirect on some malicious website.

> The IDN (Malicious link which i add in website) :   https://ebÐ°y.com
