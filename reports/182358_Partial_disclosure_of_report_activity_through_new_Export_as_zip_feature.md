## Vulnerability Information
Hello Team,
I noticed a new feature has been launched, which allows to export report. Great feature.
But unfortunately it discloses comments of partially disclosed reports which supposed to be hidden..

###POC:
* Go to this partially disclosed report > https://hackerone.com/reports/██████████
* Click **Export** Button.
* You'll see comments are getting disclosed!

{F134909}

This way you can see all the partially disclosed reports comments.

Please let me know if you need more information!

Looking forward!
