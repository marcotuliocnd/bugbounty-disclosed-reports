## Vulnerability Information
Hi Team,

I have noticed that, when user change his email through account setting, user doesn't get any notification or confirmation to change an email from xxxx to yyyyy. If user kept his/her account logged-in into PC, cafe, college systems then attacker can change his/her email to own mail and can takeover the account of victim.

Scenario :
1. I changed my email1 to email2 through profile
2. Sign-out the account and try to log-in using email1
3. It was failed and when I used email2 its working.

Similarly user can change his/her password to takeover account.

Please let me know if any help is needed.

Thanks and regards,
Kiddie..!!
