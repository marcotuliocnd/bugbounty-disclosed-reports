## Vulnerability Information
Hi Team,

This looks like a very critical issue so you should fix it ASAP.

Steps to reproduce :
1.Go to your mopub account and create a segment in your network.
2.You will get a segment ID now.
3.Now Go to the API link : https://app.mopub.com/networks/v2/api/segment/[Segment_id]
Note : page will take lot of time to open and your browser may crash because the response will have all the Apps in mohub with there hash key.
4.When the page will be opened you can see all the Apps in App section.
