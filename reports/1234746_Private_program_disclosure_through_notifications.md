## Vulnerability Information
Hello Team,

**Summary:**

I recently came across hackerone report: https://hackerone.com/reports/1179241 . I though this was fixed but today I have have faced similar experience. I have received a Scope and policy update from the program "██████" which I am not part of. 

████████


When I was clicking on the notifications, scope update notification is taking me to hacktivity page and policy update notification is taking me to "Page not found page", I think the previous fix to #1179241 is not complete  . As a proof, I have attached a video poc and screenshots.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Login to Hackerone account
2. Checked my notifications

## POC

██████████

## Impact

I was able to received notification updates of a private program to which I am not part of. This discloses the private program handle to which i am not part of.
