## Vulnerability Information
Hi team.
 
I made 2 accounts and purchased burpsuite pro.
The first account with this email :- ███████
The second account with this email :- ██████

I have opened a support ticket on  Jun 13, 2018 05:26PM and the message is :- 

Hi

Could you please add this account to my existing account


████
███████

to may another account

Email address: ██████████
███

and change the name from

licensed to Sara Badran [single user license]

To

Burp Suite Professional - licensed_to_Emad__Shanab_[single_user_license]

Because i made a purchase from my another account but my old license will expire in 2 month and i need to merge my new account with the old one in one license and please change the license hash because i feel Iam, get hacked

The another license is:-

I just need to merge the accounts or change the license name to me with new hash to avoid any one to use it .

Thanks

And the team replied to me with this message:--

We have transferred the license key on █████ to █████████’s account.
