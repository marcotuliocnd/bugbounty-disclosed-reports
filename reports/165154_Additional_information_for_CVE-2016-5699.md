## Vulnerability Information
I was not the first to report this issue, but the fix languished for quite some time, since no one realized quite how bad it was.  I wasn't aware of the original bug report and discovered the issue independently.  I was the first to report the much more serious consequences of it.  The vulnerability itself was technically public and fixed, and I waited 6 months to publish the more serious attack scenarios (when a CVE was finally publicly requested).
