## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:**

when navigating to https://hackerone.com/YOUR_PROGRAM_HANDLE/display_options
and unchecking the **Reports resolved** checkbox, the resolved bugs number won't be public at the program page, but going to https://hackerone.com/directory?query=YOUR_PROGRAM_HANDLE , the number of the resolved bug will bo shown although it was set no to be visible.

if this is intended behavior then I don't under stand why this settings option does exist!

thanks you!
