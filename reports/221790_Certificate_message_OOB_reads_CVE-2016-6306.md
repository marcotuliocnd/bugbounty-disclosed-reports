## Vulnerability Information
In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in
OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical
DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.

The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and
server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against
a client or a server which enables client authentication.
