## Vulnerability Information
Hi Team,

I noticed, that the x-amz-meta-s3cmd-attrs  response header returns sensitive information, like system username on data.gov

x-amz-meta-s3cmd-attrs: uid:0/gname:root/uname:root/gid:0/mode:33184/mtime:1513269652/atime:1513269652/md5:2049644b6b833f5dbb826f60a4721f64/ctime:1513269652

Server: AmazonS3

Steps to reproduce:

1. POST  https://www.data.gov/app/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/core/api.php
2. Intercept the request in burp and see the response header values with system username information



Suggested fix
This issue lies in the s3cmd repository: https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/issues/67
where suggested fix is adding the --â€Šno-preserve command.

## Impact

The attacker can gain sensitive information about system username. In this case it was root, so i marked impact as Low. Still, the developers can have a good reason to not expose this information in the response header.
