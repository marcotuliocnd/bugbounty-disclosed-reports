## Vulnerability Information
I would like to report a command injection vulnerability in kill-port. It allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. 

# Module

**module name:** kill-port
**version:** 1.3.1
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/kill-port`

## Module Description

 Kill the process running on given port

## Module Stats

5,282 downloads in the last week

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

If an attacker can control the port, which in itself is a very sensitive value, he can inject arbitrary OS commands due to the usage of exec in a third-party module.

## Steps To Reproduce:

```js
const kill = require('kill-port');
kill("23;`touch ./success.txt; 2222222222`");
```

## Patch

N/A replace exec (through execa.shell) with spawn

## Supporting Material/References:

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: N
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

She can inject arbitrary commands. However, I assume that the real impact is not that high, since for most usages of the package I do not expect the user to be able to control the port value.
