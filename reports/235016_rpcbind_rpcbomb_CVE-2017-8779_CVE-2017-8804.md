Writeup: https://guidovranken.wordpress.com/2017/05/03/rpcbomb-remote-rpcbind-denial-of-service-patches/
Demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b38H3oEgrQw (this video shows that the attack doesn't necessarily just crashes the rpcbind process, but that the entire system can slow down severely because it has to resort to swap memory, even if overcommit is enabled. This implies scope=changed in the CVSS. But I filled out unchanged to be consistent with the official assessment)
