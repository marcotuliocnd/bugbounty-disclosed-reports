## Vulnerability Information
Hi team,
First of all congrats for good work to enforced the new password security policy during registration but the password error banner is not updated as per the changes. During registration it only shows the error when i enter the password if is is less than 8 chars. but if i enter the 8+ chars error will say "Please fix this field.". Without knowing the exact error message it will be difficult to put good password. Same error message is showing while signing in.
