## Vulnerability Information
Nextcloud introduced WebAuthn passwordless authentication with version 19. As far as we understand, you assume that your implementation provide two-factor authentication:

"The server asking for authentication can request verification of multiple factors, so that a configured key requires the user to not just plug it in but also enter a PIN or scan a finger print." (see https://www.nitrokey.com/news/2020/what-passwordless-world-looks )

We found the same issue like in Microsoftâ€™s implementation: userVerification is not set and the UV flag is not checked on the server. Thus, even though a FIDO2 key with a PIN is added in a user account, the PIN is not required to log in.

## Impact

We have a nice video in our blog post:  https://hwsecurity.dev/2020/06/webauthn-pin-bypass/

An attacker could log into the victims account without a PIN by sneaking up on the victim and using the security hardware over NFC.
