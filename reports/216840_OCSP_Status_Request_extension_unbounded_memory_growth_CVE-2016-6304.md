## Vulnerability Information
A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension.
If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status
Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the
server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory
exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do
not support OCSP. Builds using the "no-ocsp" build time option are not affected.
