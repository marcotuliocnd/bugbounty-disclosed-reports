## Vulnerability Information
HI,

Reference :- #176002

People use 2fa to protect his / her account from unwanted access and for getting secure from information leak.

you were displaying the last 4 digits of a user's phone number after login (e.g. "we've send a code to xxx-1234").

Industry standard is to show 2 digits instead of 4 digits.

Kind Regards !
