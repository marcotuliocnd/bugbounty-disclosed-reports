its possible to add such email in user account
i also reported  this flaw of email REGEX  https://hackerone.com/reports/226334 but you ignored

i also tried this payload but cant confirm that file has been created or not because i was testing in your website
you can also confirm by locally

Using the above username ( as") break the sql query during email sending cause exception throw

also checked that if i used that username in password reset ,server response time is delayed
it may cause Dos attack but it not possible in that case because u using Cloudflare network to prevent
