## Vulnerability Information
By upgrading your plan to the new premium+ plan immediately after your profile pic changes you can sidestep the review process allowing users to continously change their profile pictures without them being reviewed. 

You can do this upgrading and downgrading the plans. 

I have detailed this in a thread on x here.

I did try to reach out but couldn't find a support for that fit this criteria.

## Impact

This is not an attach point but it is however a way of bypassing the system and safe guards x have in place to potentially allow malicious profile pictures that avoid the review process.
