## Vulnerability Information
**Summary:** 
Configuration files for Nginx in nodejs/build repository have multiple off-by-slash misconfigurations. Because nodejs.org and iojs.org are deployed using those files, it is possible for an attacker to gain access to unexpected directories. (**This report is not related to nodejs/node.** Therefore, I understand that this report is not eligible to Bounty.)

**Description:** 
The following files have multiple off-by-slash misconfigurations.
- https://github.com/nodejs/build/blob/main/ansible/www-standalone/resources/config/nodejs.org
- https://github.com/nodejs/build/blob/main/ansible/www-standalone/resources/config/iojs.org

For example, the following `/metrics` endpoint has no trailing slash, while the alias parameter has a trailing slash.
```
    location /metrics {
        alias /home/dist/metrics/;
        autoindex on;
        default_type text/plain;
    }
```
The setting as above is commonly known as an off-by-slash misconfiguration.
In this case, an attacker can access files in `/home/dist` directory via `/metrics../` endpoint.

## Steps To Reproduce:
For example, you can browse the contents of `/home/dist/.bashrc` by accessing `https://nodejs.org/metrics../.bashrc`.

## Impact: 
If sensitive files exist in the dist user's home directory, it is possible for an attacker to view their contents.

## Impact

An attacker can access files in the `/home/dist` directory of the nodejs.org and iojs.org servers.
