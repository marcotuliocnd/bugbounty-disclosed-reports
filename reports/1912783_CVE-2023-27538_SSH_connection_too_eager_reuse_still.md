## Vulnerability Information
libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited reuse.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, two SSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily.

## Hackerone report
#1898475

## Impact

Connection reuse when different ssh keys are specified.
