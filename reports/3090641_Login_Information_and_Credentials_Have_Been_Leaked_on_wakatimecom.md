## Vulnerability Information
Hello there,

I am writing to inform you that a critical security vulnerability has been identified on **wakatime.com**, where user login information, including usernames and passwords, has been leaked to the public. This issue appears to stem from insufficient protection of sensitive data, potentially due to inadequate encryption or improper handling of credentials during transmission or storage. Exposure to this information poses a significant risk to users, as it could lead to unauthorized access to accounts, identity theft, and further exploitation of personal or financial data.

## Data Source:
The information about this breach was initially identified and shared within Telegram groups, where leaked credentials were posted and discussed. These groups serve as both a warning system and a distribution channel for such breaches, highlighting the urgent need for organizations to monitor these platforms for early detection of security incidents.
I have been collecting this data for a long time. In cases where I collected the data, most Telegram groups were shut down for violating the rules. Those that are still active have cleared their chat logs. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which group this data was initially shared with and when. However, I have included some active Telegram groups for your reference.

## Impact

The impact of this breach is severe and multifaceted.
Firstly, users whose credentials have been compromised are at immediate risk of account hijacking, which could result in unauthorized actions such as fraudulent purchases, data manipulation, or the dissemination of private information.
Secondly, since many individuals reuse passwords across multiple platforms, the breach could extend its effects beyond **wakatime.com**, endangering accounts on other websites or services.
Furthermore, the reputational damage is substantial, as customers may lose trust in the platform’s ability to safeguard their personal information. 
Legal ramifications may also arise if the breach violates data protection regulations like GDPR or CCPA, potentially leading to fines and lawsuits. Immediate action is required to mitigate these risks and restore user confidence.

>Please note that I do not know how many valid credentials there are. I did not try to log in with any of them. To check each credential individually, it is against the [policy](https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/8369826-detailed-platform-standards#h_83c05e1cc8).

### I have attached the files containing usernames and corresponding passwords.
