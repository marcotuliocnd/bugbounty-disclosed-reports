## Vulnerability Information
Summary:
-----------
The vulnerability allows  user to change the project name to a malicious string, which results in other users being logged out of their accounts when they attempt to access the project. This leads to a denial of service for all users attempting to interact with the affected project, severely impacting its availability

 Steps To Reproduce:
---------------------
  1. ( F3703735 ) here i have created a project  with name ss. Then i have added the other user to the project (F3703740).

 2. (F3703744) now i am changing the project name into "-script----window-doppler_config-hydrationcontext-user-__proto__-isadmin---true-" since i was trying for prototype pollution and instantly i am logged out due to security reason F3703753 . The prototype pollution or cross site scripting was not successfull, But the project name was successfully changed to malicious string stored inside the account. 

  3. Now i have logged in from another user account which i have added previously to the project. From this account the project is displayed F3703757. Now any user cannot open the project and also delete the project even if he has admin role to that project. Thus acting like a D.O.S attack and also high impact on availability because the project is not accessible.

## Impact

Denial of Service (DoS)
-------------------------
The primary impact of this vulnerability is that no user, including administrators, can edit or access the project after it has been manipulated. This effectively denies all users the ability to manage or update the project, leading to significant operational disruption.


Impact on Availability
---------------------
The project's availability is severely compromised. Users attempting to access the project are automatically logged out, preventing any interaction with the project. This not only disrupts ongoing work but also hinders collaborative efforts
