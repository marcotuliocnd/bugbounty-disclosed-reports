## Vulnerability Information
Hello,

The vulnerable code portion is linked below. The linked function is responsible for printing PGM packet payload information to the terminal (e.g., stdout)

https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/4601c685e7fd19c3724d5e499c69b8d3ec49933e

The issue may be reproduced as follows

Check out vulnerable tcpdump commit (< 4.9.2) as follows

```
$ git clone -b 26a6799b9ca80508c05cac7a9a3bef922991520b https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump
```

Build it with afl and AddressSanitizer as follows (please install libpcap before this step)

```
$ CC=afl-gcc
$ AFL_USE_ASAN=1 make -j
```

Run tcpdump against linked payload (link: https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/blob/4601c685e7fd19c3724d5e499c69b8d3ec49933e/tests/pgm_opts_asan_2.pcap?raw=true)

```
$ tcpdump -nvr <payload>
reading from file /tmp/pgm_opts_asan_2.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
