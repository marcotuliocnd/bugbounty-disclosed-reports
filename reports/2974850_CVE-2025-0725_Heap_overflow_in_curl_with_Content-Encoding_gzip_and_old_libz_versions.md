## Vulnerability Information
Hello,
I would like to report a vulnerability here that I previously reported to the curl project.

In curl's support for old libz version lies an integer overflow that can be triggered by a malicious http server by serving
abnormally large gzip headers that then leads to a heap overflow with attacker-controlled data when `Content-Encoding: gzip`
is used.
