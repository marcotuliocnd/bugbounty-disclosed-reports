## Vulnerability Information
Sir,

I want to report a bug in your web which i have found in few minutes ago :)

I have registered In your website and i have found a upload option i want to upload some php files but its saying only .pdf file allowed so i have just change my (.php) file extension to (.pdf) first its saying not allowed its not a pdf file or file is corrupted... But when i try to upload it using post data i have successfully uploaded corrupted file 

here is my proof:
 
https://85aa27de34e32ac9f9e0-e519cb8a62f48aa14df288cdc83ab719.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/hipaa_forms/2016/06/b193e25b-3218-4a09-8b09-b17bea6d5a18.pdf

its a php shell 

if a attacker can change the value and successfully upload .php file using http request it can be risk for your webserver :)


Thanks
