## Vulnerability Information
Hello IBB team, i would like to submit a report about Apache Tomcat DoS vulnerability that i have reported to the Tomcat team, which was assigned to CVE-2024-34750 and disclosed yesterday.

**Details:**
When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.

**Here is the email thread that i contacted the security team:**
██████████

## Impact

Since HTTP/2 connections are left open indefinitely, depending on configuration the DoS is caused either by the server running out of memory or by the open connections reaching maxConnections.
