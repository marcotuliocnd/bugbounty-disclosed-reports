## Vulnerability Information
About 5 mins ago a new website was just registered by Shopify. https://github-issues-tracker.shopifycloud.com/. This contains title of all the internal github issues that Shopify currently has. I wanted to let you know right away of this as soon as I saw it. I am testing this further to get more information in the mean time.
