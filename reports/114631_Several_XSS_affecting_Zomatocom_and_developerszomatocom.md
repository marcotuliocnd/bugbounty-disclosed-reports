Hi there, I have found several XSS in Zomato.com and developers.zomato.com

A. Steps to reproduce:

                                             (<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>)

B. Now in developers.zomato.com:
1. Go to developers.zomato.com
2. Go to "widgets" tab
3. Look for "Restaurant Search" widget and click "Add Widget"
4. Now a window will open (restaurant search), on the left side, you will see "Search for restaurant, cuisine or a dish" now, enter the payload   (<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>) in the seachbar, XSS popup.

C. developers.zomato.com (II)

3. Look for "Foodie Index Widget"
4. Click "add widget"
