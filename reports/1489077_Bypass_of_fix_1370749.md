## Vulnerability Information
Hello team,

on report #1370749 the reporter found that the preview link is not expiring. So when someone will gain access to the preview link, he can access it for whole life as the preview link remains the same even after changing the storefont password. I have reported the issue #1401525 where i am getting the preview link with a user with limited permission. But it was duplicate of #1370749, because on that fix , getting the storefont url couldn't be accessed later after changing the store password.
The report #1370749 has been fixed and the fix worked properly now upon changing the storefont password the previous preview link is expiring. But i have found another endpoint where it is leaking the storefont preview url and the strange thing is , it is not expiring even after the password change for the store font. It is remaining static and we can access the store through that permanently.

```
Note the 5th and 6th line , there is an image url https://cdn.shopify.com/screenshots/shopify/z0069ofg35eaiunlanwztkkvti19n2o-62790336753.shopifypreview.com?height=600&amp;version=b5dc22c6d802d34212a20d2f443e1e570f0759468f4b0022c642916aeb4e3d2c&amp;width=350

4- Note the preview url from that image url that is z0069ofg35eaiunlanwztkkvti19n2o-62790336753.shopifypreview.com
5- Now navigate to admin and check the preview url, it is https://yok8gcda4v2iypbq-62790336753.shopifypreview.com/
6- Remove user-a and change store font's password , Now the updated preview url will be https://b0b27da00akv5xui-62790336753.shopifypreview.com/
7- check the preview url from step-5 which is https://yok8gcda4v2iypbq-62790336753.shopifypreview.com, this will show expired.
8- But navigate to the preview url you got from step-4 ( z0069ofg35eaiunlanwztkkvti19n2o-62790336753.shopifypreview.com ) that is gained by the attacker user .

Now you can still have permanent access to the storefont through the preview url z0069ofg35eaiunlanwztkkvti19n2o-62790336753.shopifypreview.com, even if the store password got changed and the user has been removed after being suspect.

## Impact

Bypassing the fix #1370749 and getting a previw url which is giving permanent access to the storefont even after multiple password change.
