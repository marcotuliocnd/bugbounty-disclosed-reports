## Vulnerability Information
When curl saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name.

In that rename operation, it might accidentally widen the permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users than intended.

## Impact

Information disclosure (cookie file in specific)
