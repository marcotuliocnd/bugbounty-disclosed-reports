## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:

It's possible to open links pointing to `file:///` origin from web pages using "Open link in a new tab" in context menu.

> https://hackerone.com/bugs?report_id=369185 shows unsafe `ssh://` protocol handling, which leads to information leak using ssh(OS username and etc.). The vulnerability is highly available, so it's possible to leverage it.

As of, we could get username, it's easy to predict path of the downloaded file:
`file:///Users/${USERNAME_FROM_SSH}/Download/${DOWNLOADED_FILE_NAME}`

### USERNAME_FROM_SSH 

When user initiates ssh session through browser, it's equal to running `ssh os_username@hostname.com`. So the host which receives connection request knows user's OS username.

### DOWNLOADED_FILE_NAME 

DOWNLOADED_FILE_NAME is `download` attribute of the link. That means, it's under the attacker's control.

## Products affected: 

Brave 0.22.810
V8 6.7.288.43
rev 8f30eeb
Muon 7.0.6
OS Release 17.6.0
Update Channel Release
OS Architecture x64
OS Platform macOS
Node.js 7.9.0
Brave Sync v1.4.2
libchromiumcontent 67.0.3396.71
OS: macOS 10.13.5 17F77 x86_64

## Steps To Reproduce:

Live PoC: https://brave-download-execute-local-fs-ifhsmtsbik.now.sh

> I could provide a PoC with "ssh step", if it could increase a bounty. Currently, OS username is hardcoded in `exploit.html`. Insert your **OS username** to run the exploit. (e.g. using devtools or locally)

1. Webpage requests navigation to `ssh://` -  user agrees.
2. Navigation happens, attacker's host received ssh connection request. Attacker knows user's OS username.
3. Webpage asks to download the file. Let's name it `file-load.html`. Downloading happens.
4. User opens a link(using "Open in a new tab") which points to `file:///Users/${USERNAME_FROM_SSH}/Download/file-load.html`
5. Navigation happens, downloaded HTML file executes on local file system.

Screencast attached.

## Impact

Navigation from web pages to `file:///` and executing downloaded (from the web) files on local filesystem is definitely a vulnerability, which additionally opens a wider attack surface for an attacker. 

> ~~Bypassing SOP on `file:///` origin could lead to a full-chain exploit ðŸ˜ˆ.~~
