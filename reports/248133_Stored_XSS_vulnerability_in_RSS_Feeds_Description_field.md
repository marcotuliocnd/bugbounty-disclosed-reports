## Vulnerability Information
## Intro

"Pirates of the Crayons"

__Type of issue__: Core CMS issue
__Level of severity__: Internal Attack Vector
__Concrete5 version__: 8.2.0 RC2 rev. b54f2b451f0a0804699c4cf9f0b3a8fef0e407db (July 10th)

## Summary

There is Stored XSS vulnerability in RSS Feeds ```Description``` property. Value of the textarea is not properly sanitized and malicious JavaScript code can be saved and executed every time user visits Feed screen.

## Steps to reproduce

- log in to concrete5 instance
- go to RSS Feeds and click on Add Feed button
- in feed ```Description``` textarea put following payload:

```html
Description
</textarea>
<script>alert('XSS!')</script>
```

{F201814}

- click ```Add``` button

Now, select added feed from ```RSS Feeds``` list. JavaScript payload will execute.

{F201813}

## Impact

Although this issue has no such big impact as previously reported by Corben Douglas (@sxcurity) report https://hackerone.com/reports/221380 (Stored XSS in RSS Feeds Title (Concrete5 v8.1.0)) because it requires user to enter into feed edit form - this issue introduces internal attack vector on any concrete5 user as well.

## Testing environment

System:

- Concrete5 version 8.2.0 RC2, commit b54f2b451f0a0804699c4cf9f0b3a8fef0e407db (July 10th), installed localy
- PHP ver. 5.6.30
