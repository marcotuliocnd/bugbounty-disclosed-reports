## Vulnerability Information
I found an XSS vulnerability on buy button.
**Steps to reproduce**
Go to Settings > General > Store currency > Change formatting and add on "HTML with currency" the payload `â‚¬{{amount}} "><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)>`
After that go to buy button and you will see that the payload triggers there.

## Impact

A staff member can takeover another account.
