## Vulnerability Information
Hi Team
Hope you are doing well.
I found vulnerability.

Issue: Email Spoofing

I just sent a forged email to junaidasghar165@gmail.com that appears to originate from privacy@sifchain.finance

I was able to do this because of  SPF Soft Fail  and I could not find  DMARC record of this domain.

SPF record lookup and validation for: sifchain.finance
Found v=spf1 record for sifchain.finance:
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:spf.autopilothq.com include:sendgrid.net ~all

As you can see the symbol at last which is (~all) is the issue, which should be replaced by Hyphen (-all) symbol.

Please refer to the digital ocean article for understanding.

Waiting for your response.

## Impact

Email spoofing is the forgery of an email header so that the message appears to have originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual source. Email spoofing is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source. The goal of email spoofing is to get recipients to open, and possibly even respond to, a solicitation
