## Vulnerability Information
Hello Team,

I noticed that it is not necessary to put your Password when Changing Emails, Password, etc..
which is easy to an attacker to Change it's Victim's Credentials when he hijack or takeover an account on wordpress forum account.

Let me know if you need more information.
Best Regards,
