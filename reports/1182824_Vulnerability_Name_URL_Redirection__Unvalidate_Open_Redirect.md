## Supporting Material/References:
[If possible, applications should avoid incorporating user-controllable data into redirection targets. In many cases, this behavior can be avoided in two ways:

   -Remove the redirection function from the application, and replace links to it with direct links to the relevant target URLs.
   -Maintain a server-side list of all URLs that are permitted for redirection. Instead of passing the target URL as a parameter to the redirector, pass an index into     this list.

If it is considered unavoidable for the redirection function to receive user-controllable input and incorporate this into the redirection target, one of the following measures should be used to minimise the risk of redirection attacks:

  -The application should use relative URLs in all of its redirects, and the redirection function should strictly validate that the URL received is a relative URL.
  -The application should use URLs relative to the web root for all of its redirects, and the redirection function should validate that the URL received starts with a    slash character. It should then prepend http://yourdomainname.com to the URL before issuing the redirect.
  -The application should use absolute URLs for all of its redirects, and the redirection function should verify that the user-supplied URL begins with    http://yourdomainname.com/ before issuing the redirect.]
