## Vulnerability Information
## Summary:

The SyntaxHighlighter plugin used in the comments section of *.wordpress.com sites is vulnerable to stored XSS via a crafted payload.

## Platform(s) Affected:

*.wordpress.com

SyntaxHighlighter is also an open source plugin which is affected by this vulnerability:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/

Automattic is listed as a developer/contributor to this plugin, so I'm hoping that this is the right place to pass along this vulnerability report in order to get a fix implemented within the plugin as well. Please let me know if it is not.

## Proof of Concept:

	[code]javascript://%0dalert%28document.cookie%29[/code]

This creates a link with the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol that can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript when clicked. The vulnerability is actually with the regular expression used to match and auto-link URLs within the code block:

	/\w+:\/\/[\w-.\/?%&=:@;#]*/g

In the version of SyntaxHighlighter that comes bundled in the open-source plugin, the regex is:

	/&lt;\w+:\/\/[\w-.\/?%&=@:;]*&gt;|\w+:\/\/[\w-.\/?%&=@:;]*/g

The `\w+` character class part of `\w+:\/\/` is too loose IMO. I would recommend modifying the regex to match a whitelist of protocols similar to what KSES does within WordPress, or disable auto-linking within SyntaxHighlighter.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Visit https://mattstestsite128160580.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/test-post/ in Firefox or Chrome.
1. Submit `[code]javascript://%0dalert%28document.cookie%29[/code]` as a comment.
1. Click the `javascript://` portion of the rendered highlighted code.

## Impact

The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript as the victim user's account with the security context of the <site>.wordpress.com domain.
